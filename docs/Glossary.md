# Glossary

**Class**: A  class  describes  a set  of  objects  that  share  the  same  specifications  of  features,
constraints, and semantics. Class is a kind of classifier whose features are attributes and operations.

**Class diagram**: A type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the
system's  classes,  their  attributes,  operations  (or  methods),  and  the  relationships  among  the classes.

**Efficient**: The capability of the software product
to provide appropriate performance,relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions [ISO/IEC 25000].

**Error**: A human action that produces an incorrect result [After IEEE 610].

**Function**: A description  of “what” a system does. A function has a corresponding implied purpose and  is  a  fundamental  part  of  a  system  description:  a  system  consists  of  function  attributes,
performance  attributes,resource  (cost)  attributes  and  design  attributes.  All  attributes  exist  with respect to defined specified conditions. A function can often be decomposed into a hierarchical set of sub-functions [TGilb].

**Functionality**: The  capability  of  the  software  product  to  provide  functions  which  meet  statedand implied needs when the software is used under specified conditions[ISO/IEC 25000].

**High-level**: A  position  in  a hierarchy of  defined  system  components, which  is  closer  to  the  top than the bottom, relative to the total defined set of those components [TGilb].

**Input**: A variable (whether stored within a component or outside) that is read by a component.

**Maintenance**: Modification  of  a  software  product  after  delivery  to  correct  defects,
to  improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment [IEEE 1219].

**Object**: In OOAD an instance of a class.

**OOAD**: *see Object-oriented analysis and design.*

**OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

**Output**: A variable (whether stored within a component or outside) that is written by a component.

**Performance**: The  degree  to  which  a  system  or  component  accomplishes  its  designated functions within
given   constraints  regarding   processing   time   and   through put   rate   [IEEE 610].
See also *efficiency.*

**Personal data**: Private information pertaining to an individual's ID, and phone number,
and is not meant to be publicly shared.

**Priority**: The level of (business) importance assigned to an item, e.g. defect.

**Product**: An output of a process.

**Project**: A project is a unique  set of coordinated and controlled activities with start  and finish dates undertaken to achieve an objective conforming to specific requirements,
including the constraints of time, cost and resources [ISO 9000].

**Requirement**:  (1) A  condition  or  capability  needed  by  a  user  to  solve  a  problem  or  achieve  an objective.
(2)  A  condition  or  capability  that  must  be  met  or  possessed  by  a  system  or  system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents.
(3) A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2) [IEEE 610].

**Review**: An evaluation of a product or project status to ascertain discrepancies from planned results and to recommend improvements.
Examples include management review, informal review, technical review, inspection, and walkthrough [IEEE 1028].

**Sequence  diagram**: In  UML  it  is  a  structured  representation  of  behavior  as  a  series  of  sequential steps  over  time.
Sequence  diagram  is  a  kind  of  interaction  diagram  that  shows  how  processes operate with one another and in what order.

**Software**: Computer   programs,   procedures, and   possibly   associated   documentation   and   data pertaining to the operation of a computer system [IEEE 610].

**Standard**: Formal,  possibly  mandatory,  set  of  requirements  developed  and  used  to  prescribe consistent  approaches  to
the  way  of  working  or  to  provide  guidelines  (e.g.,  ISO/IEC  standards,  IEEE standards, and organizational standards) [CMMI].

**System**: A  collection  of  components  organized  to  accomplish  a  specific  function  or  set  of  functions [IEEE 610].

**UML**: see Unified Modeling Language.

**Unified  Modeling  Language**: A  standardized  general-purpose  modeling  language  in  the  field  of software engineering.
UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of software-intensive systems like use case diagrams, activity diagrams,
class diagrams and many more. see UML.

**User**: A person who uses a software product.

**Version**: A specific form or variation of something.
