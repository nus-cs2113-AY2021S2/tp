Welcome to the user guide for our application, Connoisseur!

Connoisseur is a desktop application for managing and storing personal reviews on experiences and recommendations to try next. It is a revolutionary app that not only provides an organised user-friendly database, but provides customisable categories to enhance your experience. Through its intuitive command line interface, you will be able to store and access your reviews & recommendation easily!

## 2. About this Guide

This guide gives you an overview of the features in Connoisseur and shows you how to get started using Connoisseur.

### 2.1 What is in Connoisseur

In our Review mode, you can add a review about an experience, delete or edit a review, view the
entire list of your reviews or if you want the full details, just view a particular review. You can also sort the list from the highest to the lowest rating, by category, title, earliest or latest date.

For our Recommendation mode, you can have a list of things you would like to try, the location and the approximate cost of the experience. Already tried out the experience? You can now move it to your review list and record your thoughts on the experience!

* A highlight (called a mark-up) indicates a keyword. It is often used to indicate i) a field or command that can be typed into the 
  command line and executed by Connoisseur; or ii) the prompts displayed by Connoisseur. <br> e.g.`list [SORTING METHOD]`
* Words in UPPER CASE in square bracket [USER INPUT] are the fields to be supplied by the user.<br> e.g.

This section covers all the commands that you can type into the Command Box of Connoisseur when it prompts you -
`Please enter a command: `

The commands are categorised into the two modes offered by Connoisseur, Review and Recommendation mode. If it is the
first time that you are using the commands, we recommend that you refer
to [How to use the Guide](#22-how-to-use-this-guide) to better interpret the format of the commands.

category. The review mode can be accessed using the `review` command as shown in the figure below.

Command: `add [quick | full]`, `new [quick | full]`<br>

<span>&#10071;</span> Connoisseur will ignore extra blank spaces that are typed in between the two words in the command. <br>

<span>&#10071;</span> Connoisseur will ignore extra blank spaces that are typed before or after the command.

If quick review is specified, Connoisseur will then prompt you to enter the title, category and rating of the review, as
shows in _Figure 5_.<br />

![img_3.png](images/ug/full_review.png)
<p align="center">Figure 6. Adding a full review </p>

If you do not specify `[quick | full]` and simply input the command: `add` or `new`, Connoisseur will ask you to

If you input an invalid number Connoisseur will prompt you until a valid number is input. <br />

<span>&#10071;</span> Ensure the title of the review added is unique and does not already exist in the list. Connoisseur 
checks for duplicate by comparing spelling, and the number of blank spaces in between words in the title. Refer to table 1 below for examples.

#### 4.1.2 List Reviews

This feature allows you to view a list of all your reviews. You can specify a one-off sorting method by which to sort
the reviews.

Command: `list [SORTING METHOD]`

`[SORTING METHOD]` (optional argument) temporary sort method by which to sort the reviews. Leaving this blank would
allow Connoisseur to use the saved _sort method_ (refer to [4.1.3](#413-sort-reviews)) as shown in Figure 8. Currently, supported methods are:

* `title`
* `category`
* `rating`
* `earliest`
* `latest`
  
<span>&#10071;</span> Connoisseur will ignore extra blank spaces that are typed before or after the command.

<span>&#10071;</span> For usage, Connoisseur commands are case insensitive.<br>
For example, `list` is equivalent to `LiSt`.

<span>&#10071;</span> Connoisseur will ignore extra blank spaces that are typed in between the two words in the command. <br>

![img_5.png](images/ug/list_rating.png)
<p align="center">Figure 8. Listing reviews </p>

9a or in Figure 9b, where the ratings and partitions are not displayed correctly, input the command `display asterisks` as shown in Figure 10. The
error should be resolved, and the ratings will now be displayed using `*` symbol instead. To switch back to displaying 
★ and ✰ symbols input the command `display stars`
