ModMan, short for Module Manager, is an all in one platform to help Teaching Assistants (TAs) like yourself manage their modules. Optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), ModMan allows you to keep track of all your students, assignments and lessons anytime, anywhere! Take advantage of unique features such as autograding and storing comments for assignments, so that you can focus on the more enjoyable parts of being a TA. 

### What is a CLI?
A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to view and manage computer files.

Examples of CLIs include operating system CLIs like the Command Prompt on Windows and the Terminal on macOS. CLIs can be used to run and interact with the ModMan application easily.

## 1. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 installed on your computer or install it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
1. Download the latest `ModMan.jar` release from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-1/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
1. Open a command window in the folder containing the `.jar` file.
1. Run the command `java -jar {filename}.jar` <br> If you haven't changed the filename, run the command `java -jar ModMan.jar`

<hr style="border:1px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 1.1 Input Formatting
This section covers points to note about proper input formats for commands.

1. Commands that do not accept any parameters (`help`, `current` etc.) will display wrong command error if any parameters are entered.
2. For commands with flags (ie. `/t`, `/s`):
    * All flags must be entered completely in the order specified in command format.
    * There is one whitespace before and after each flag eg. `/t<space>TYPE<space>/v<space>...`; Input would be truncated if spaces are not present.</br>
        * `/t<space>/v...`: One space between flags, second flag would not be recognised.
        * `/t<space><space>/v...`: Two spaces between flags, input for flag `/t` would be parsed as empty.
        * `.../s 1600/e 1800`: `START_TIME` will be parsed as `160`.
    * Any inputs within the space between the flags would be trimmed for whitespaces.
        * `/t<space><space>Lecture<space><space><space>/v ...`: Input for `/t` will be trimmed to `Lecture`.
    
| :warning: | Inputs that do not follow this format would be invalid. |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

<hr style="border:1px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 1.2 Database File Tampering

This section provides a warning for the handling of database for ModMan. 

| :warning: | The database of ModMan is stored in the `Database.txt` file. **You should not tamper with the file**.<br>If you delete or edit the contents of the `Database.txt` file such that there are duplicate `Module`, `Student`,`Lesson` or `Assignment` or introduce any invalid attributes or formatting, the data will likely be corrupted.<br>In such cases, the program will create a new database upon starting. |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

If you delete the whole `Database.txt`, a new `Database.txt` would be created for you.

Although not recommended, edits may be made in `Database.txt` that effects changes in ModMan while still loading those changes in when starting up.
* For example, changing student name of `Student` to another name that does not match any other `Student`.

|----------------------|-------------------------------------|


The deadline has to follow a strict format to allow you to easily sort your assignments by deadline later on!

Examples of usage:</br>

1. `set assignment deadline /a quiz1 /d 16 08 2021`

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    I have set quiz1's deadline to Aug 16 2021 in CS2113T
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```
2. `set assignment deadline /a quiz2 /d 17 08 1999`

    Note that only year 2021 to 2030 is accepted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

| :bulb: | You can set your own deadlines to be earlier than the actual deadline for grading to help plan your time more wisely!|
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.3 Setting Assignment Grade - `set assignment grade` <a name="setassignmentgrade"></a>

The `set assigment grade` command allows you to set the grade of a student after you have graded their assignment.
If a grade had been set previously, the grade for the student will be updated.

    I have set Jianning's grade to 100 for assignment quiz1 in CS2113T
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```
2. `set assignment grade /a quiz1 /s Jianning /g 101`

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    OOPS!!! The percentage you entered is invalid! Please provide a percentage value between 0 to 100
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

| :bulb: | You can manually set the grades of your students if you prefer a more personal touch compared to autograding|
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.4 Setting Assignment Percentage - `set assignment percentage` <a name="setassignmentpercentage"></a>

### 2.4.5 Setting Assignment Comments - `set assignment comments` <a name="setassignmentcomments"></a>
 
Sets a comment for an existing assignment. The assignment comment cannot exceed 100 characters. ModMan will eventually support comments of unlimited length (we are still working on this feature!). 
 
| :bulb: |The editing an assignment's comment feature is still in production. However, you can recreate an edit by calling the [`get assignment comments`](#getting-assignment-comments-get-assignment-comments) command, copy-pasting the result onto your terminal and editing before setting assignment comments again| 
|----------------------|-------------------------------------| 
 
Format: `set assignment comments /a ASSIGNMENT_NAME /c COMMENTS` 

Examples of usage:
* `set assignment comments /a Magic Sequence /c This assignment is well done.`
* `set assignment comments /a Forest Fruits /c Most people did not solve this assignment in full.`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.4.8 Listing Module Assignments - `list assignments` <a name="listassignments"></a>

The `list assignments` command lists out all the assignments in the current module you are working in. It also shows you information on the type of assignment 
and the due date for grading, if you have set a deadline for the assignment.

If you have executed the `sort assignments by deadline` command, the assignments will be listed in order from the most to least urgent.
Otherwise, the assignments will be listed in the order it was added. (more details on sorting assignments will be provided in section 2.4.9 `sort assignments by deadline`)

Format: `list assignments` 

Example of usage:</br> 
Let's say you have added 3 assignments to the module CS2113T and set the deadline for the first two quizzes. 
Executing the `list assignments` command will show you an expected output as shown below.

Expected output:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here are the assignments in CS2113T:
    1. quiz1 (McqAssignment) due by: Aug 17 2021
    2. quiz2 (ShortAnswerAssignment) due by: Aug 16 2021
    3. quiz3 (LongAnswerAssignment) - due date not specified.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

| :information_source: | Assignments with no deadline set will output `due date not specified` |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.9 Sorting Module Assignments - `sort assignments by deadline` <a name="sortassignmentsbydeadline"></a>

The `sort assignment by deadline` command sorts and lists the assignments in your current module by deadline, allowing you to easily keep track of which assignments have to be graded soon. 
The assignments are sorted based on the urgency of the grading from the most urgent to the least urgent. </br>

Here are some special cases to consider when sorting assignments: 
* If an assignment does not have a deadline, it will be sorted after other assignments with valid deadlines. 
* If two assignments have the same deadline or both do not have a deadline set, they will retain the initial order of when they were added to the module. 

| :bulb: | You can set your own deadlines to be earlier than the actual deadline for grading to help plan your time more wisely!|
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

Format: `sort assignments by deadline`

Here is an example of the order of assignments before and after sorting:

Before sorting:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here are the assignments in CS2113T:
    1. quiz1 (McqAssignment) - due date not specified.
    2. quiz2 (ShortAnswerAssignment) due by: Aug 17 2021
    3. quiz3 (LongAnswerAssignment) due by: Aug 16 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

After sorting:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here are the assignments in CS2113T:
    1. quiz3 (LongAnswerAssignment) due by: Aug 16 2021
    2. quiz2 (ShortAnswerAssignment) due by: Aug 17 2021
    3. quiz1 (McqAssignment) - due date not specified.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### 2.4.10 Listing Assignment Grades - `list assignment grades` <a name="listassignmentgrades"></a>

Lists the students' grades for a particular assignment.

Format: `list assignment grades /a ASSIGNMENT_NAME`

Examples of usage:
* `list assignment grades /a quiz1`
* `list assignment grades /a quiz3`

Expected output:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Here are the students' grades for the quiz1 assignment:
    1. A0214561M - 100.0
    2. A0215114X - 101.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.4.11 Viewing Assignment Answer - `view assignment answer` <a name="viewassignmentanswer"></a>

The `view assignment answer` command allows you to easily search and retrieve the answer key for an assignment just by entering the name of the assignment. </br>

Answers are stored as text files in the `answers` folder which can be found in the same working directory as the ModMan app.</br> 

| :information_source: | Naming of the answer text file has to be in the format `<ModuleCode>_<AssignmentName>.txt` for our system to be able to automatically retrieve the answers for you  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

Within the text file, the answer for each question should also follow the format `<QUESTION_NUMBER> | <ANSWER> | <MARKS>` whereby: </br>
* The first column contains the question number</br>
* The second column contains the answer for the corresponding question</br> 
* The third column contains the marks for getting that question correct</br> 

Shown below are examples of what the answer text file for an assignment should look like:</br> 
On the left, we have the answer key for an MCQ assignment quiz1.</br> 
On the right, we have the answer key for a Short Answer assignment quiz2. 

![MCQ](UGPics/answersFormat.PNG) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![ShortAnswer](UGPics/shortAnswer.PNG)

:warning: Here are some things to look out for when editing the answer text file:
* Question numbers should be in sequential order starting from 1
* Answers for MCQ assignments should only include options A to E or 1 to 5
* Answers for Short Answer and Long Answer assignments should not exceed 100 characters long
* Marks should have non-negative integer values 
* Ensure that the delimiter `|` is not used in the answer 


Format: `view assignment answer /a ASSIGNMENT_NAME`

Example of usage:</br>
Let's say you want to view the answer key to quiz1 shown above on the left.</br> 
The command `view assignment answer /a quiz1` quickly searches through the `answers` folder to display the answer key in the format `<QUESTION_NUMBER>. <ANSWER> | [<MARKS>]`.</br> 
The expected output below shows what it would look like in the app. 

Expected output: 
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer key for quiz1:
    1. A | [2] 
    2. B | [4] 
    3. C | [4] 
    4. D | [2] 
    5. A | [4] 
    6. B | [4] 
    7. C | [2] 
    8. D | [4] 
    9. E | [4] 
    10. A | [2] 
    11. B | [4] 
    12. C | [4] 
    13. D | [2] 
    14. A | [2] 
    15. A | [2] 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```
| :bulb: | You can open up the student script in another terminal so that you can view both the answer key and student script side by side! |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

<hr style="border:0.5px solid darkorange; background-color: darkorange"> </hr>

### 2.4.12 Viewing Student Script - `view student script` <a name="viewstudentscript"></a>

The `view student script` command allows you to easily search and retrieve the student's script for an assignment just by entering the name of the assignment and the student.</br> 

Scripts are stored as text files in the `scripts` folder which can be found in the same working directory as the ModMan app.</br>  

| :information_source: | Naming of the script text file has to be in the format `<ModuleCode>_<AssignmentName>_<MatricNumber>\.txt` for our system to be able to automatically retrieve the script for you  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|

Within the text file, the answer for each question should also follow the format `<QUESTION_NUMBER> | <ANSWER>` whereby:</br> 
* The first column contains the question number</br>
* The second column contains the student's answer for the corresponding question</br> 

Shown below are examples of what a student's script text file for an assignment should look like:</br> 
On the left, we have the script for an MCQ assignment quiz1.</br> 
On the right, we have the script for a Short Answer assignment quiz2. 

![MCQS](UGPics/MCQS.PNG) &nbsp;&nbsp; ![ShortAnswerS](UGPics/SAS.PNG)

:warning: Here are some things to look out for when formatting the script text file: 
* Question numbers should be in sequential order starting from 1 
* Answers for all assignment types should not exceed 100 characters long 
* Ensure that the delimiter `|` is not used in the answer 


Format: `view student script /a ASSIGNMENT_NAME /s STUDENT_NAME` 

Example of usage:</br> 
Let's say you want to view your student Jianning's script for quiz1.</br> 
The command `view student script /a Jianning` quickly searches through the `scripts` folder by matching the student name with their matric number.</br>
The script is then displayed in the format `<QUESTION_NUMBER>. <ANSWER>` for each question in the assignment.</br>
The expected output below shows what it would look like in the app.</br>
Expected output:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Jianning(A0214561M)'s script for quiz1 
    1. A 
    2. A 
    3. C 
    4. D 
    5. A 
    6. B 
    7. 1 
    8. A 
    9. E 
    10. A 
    11. B 
    12. C 
    13. D 
    14. A 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
```
| :bulb: | You can open up the answer key in another terminal so that you can view both the answer key and student script side by side!|

## 3. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data onto another computer?

**A**: Navigate to where the ModMan jar file is located and identify the Database folder. 
Copy this Database folder along with the ModMan jar file over to your other computer and place them in an empty folder.
You're now good to go to start accessing your data on your new computer!

**Q**: When is the data saved to the database?

**A**: Your data is only saved when you exit the program using the `bye` command. So always remember to say goodbye to ModMan!

**Q**: How do I delete a particular student/assignment? 

**A**: The delete feature for students and assignments are currently still work in progress but will be released in our upcoming version soon.

**Q**: How are the three assignment types different?

**A**: ModMan currently allows you to add three types of assignments - MCQ, Short Answer and Long Answer. 
MCQ assignments only allow for options `A to E` or `1 to 5` as answers while Short Answer and Long Answer assignments only have a 100 character limit for answers.
MCQ and Short Answer assignments are autogradable as they have fixed answers and grading schemes while Long Answer assignments are open-ended and allow for flexible grading.

**Q**: How do I add the answer key and students' scripts for grading?

**A**: You can simply copy and paste the answer key and student scripts into the respective folders in the working directory of ModMan named `answers` and `scripts`.
You can refer to sections `2.4.11` and `2.4.12` for more details on the format of the answer key and student script text files.

**Q**: How do I report a bug or give feedback for the application?

**A**: You are welcome to raise a new issue [*here*](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-1/tp/issues) on our project repository.
