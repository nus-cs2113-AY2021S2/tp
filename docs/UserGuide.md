## 1. Introduction to UniTracker

UniTracker is a one-stop application for NUS students to keep track of their work in school. This
product is optimal for students who prefer Command Line Interface (CLI) over Graphical User
Interface (GUI).

### 1.1 About UniTracker

UniTracker consists of 4 key features (refer to [Section 3. Features](#3-features)) that helps to
organise all the information you need in one place. You can add and edit module information, tasks,
zoom links to suit your needs.

### 1.2 About This User Guide

This user guide was made to help you set up UniTracker on your computer and also provide you with
all the information you need to use UniTracker. It clearly documents the features UniTracker offers
with examples to aid you in familiarising yourself with UniTracker.

### 1.3 How to Use This User Guide

Firstly, refer to [Section 2. Quick Start](#2-quick-start) for instructions on setting up UniTracker
on your local computer.

Once UniTracker is up and running, you can refer to the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) to
navigate to specific sections to explore, learn and use UniTracker.

Additionally, we included 'Go To [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)' and 'Go To [Command Summary](#5-command-summary)' hyperlinks at the end of every section to help you navigate through this guide easily.

### 1.4 Conventions in This User Guide

In this user guide, all text that appears on the CLI or in code will be written in a `code block`.

In the example code for each feature, all user inputs will start with an angle bracket.
E.g. `> user input`
> **Note!**  
> This is a note section. Additional useful information will be written in sections such as this one.

> **<span style="color: red"> WARNING! </span>**   
> This is a warning section. Any user interaction with UniTracker that may result in issues or unintended results will be written in sections such as this one.

#### 3.1.5 Add/View Components and Their Weightages  

Adds or displays components, 
and their weightages that adds up to 100 for an existing module.

In this sub-section, the word, "components", will be used interchangeably
to mean components or components and its associated weightage for simplicity.


>**<span style="color: red"> WARNING! </span>**  
> * You may only delete components through deleting the module object associated with it.  
> * A prompt will come after each entry to ask for your confirmation on the correctness of the component.  
> * Rationale: The assessment breakdown of a module is usually fixed.  


> **Note!**  
> * Components' weightages is only accepting integer values which is usually the convention.  
> * Old components' weightage will be overwritten automatically when a component name already exist in the program.  
> * Parsing is designed such as any inputs after weightage will be ignored. E.g. FinalExam 20 2, '2' will be ignored.  


Example for adding component and weightage to a module:

### 3.2 CAP Simulator/Calculator

The CAP Simulator/Calculator feature allows you to calculate your future CAP
base on your [current CAP and total MCs counted towards CAP](#321-add-cap-and-number-of-mcs-counted-towards-cap).  

To navigate to CAP Simulator/Calculator, type `2` from the [main menu](#3-features).

CAP Simulator/Calculator menu:

````
Please choose which action you would like to do and enter the number:
[1] --- Add CAP and Number of MCs graded taken
[2] --- View CAP and Number of MCs graded taken
[3] --- Simulate future CAP
[4] --- Exit
````
→ Go To [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)    
→ Go To [Command Summary](#5-command-summary)  

#### 3.2.1 Add CAP and Number of MCs counted towards CAP

Adds current CAP and MCs counted into the CAP.  

MCs that counts into your CAP does not include modules with zero grade points.  

> **Note!**  
> CAP entered is rounded to 2 decimal places (2dp).  
> The program exits back to CAP Simulator/Calculator menu if CAP is invalid.    
> [i.e. negative CAP or CAP > 5.0]   
> The maximum number of MCs you can add is 220.

Example of adding CAP and total MCs counted towards CAP:

#### 3.2.3 Simulate future CAP

Simulates future CAP base on the current CAP and MCs counted into the CAP.
The CAP calculated will be rounded to 2 decimal places.  

> **Note!**  
> All simulated CAP will not be stored as it is a simulation.  
> You may choose to update you CAP and MCs counted in [3.2.1](#321-add-cap-and-number-of-mcs-counted-towards-cap).  

There are two versions of CAP Simulator:
- v1.0: This version allows you to simulate CAP base on the grades you have entered before under each
  [existing module](#312-view-a-module).
- v2.0: This version allows you to simulate CAP from a fresh set of inputs from you.

To begin,
1. Ensure your current CAP and MCs counted is up to date. You may update it under [3.2.1](#321-add-cap-and-number-of-mcs-counted-towards-cap).
2. Choose the choice of your simulation. 
   * If your choice is v1.0, v1.0 CAP Simulator will calculate from the grades present in existing modules
     and returns to CAP Simulator/Calculator menu once simulation is completed.
   * If your choice is v2.0, v2.0 CAP Simulator will prompt you for a grade, followed by a prompt for MCs.

Once done, enter `ok` when prompt with entering a new grade again (for v2.0 only). 

List of accepted grades: `A+`, `A`, `A-`, `B+`, `B`, `B-`, `C+`, `C`, `D+`, `D`, `F`, `SU`


When you enter CAP Simulator, it will welcome you with the following interface!

````
Welcome to CAP Simulator!
Note: CAP Simulated takes your current CAP and total number of MCs taken into account.
If you intend to calculate your CAP solely on new entries, 
please go back to the HelpGraduation menu and set existing CAP and MCs taken to be 0.

Key in 1 to simulate your cap base on the grades you have entered before for each module.
Key in 2 to simulate cap base on your own input.
````

Example on CAP simulator:  

**Version 1**  

> **Note!**  
> Ensure the MCs and grade entered into each module is up to date for meaningful simulation. You may update the MCs and grade of each module in [3.1.6](#316-add-modules-modular-credits-mc) and [3.1.7](#317-add-module-grade) respectively.
> The grades and MCs for each simulation is shown for you to know.
