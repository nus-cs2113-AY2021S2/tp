# Movie Booking System User Guide

## Introduction

MovieApp is a desktop app for users to see the upcoming shows, book a movie and read movie reviews.
The app is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, MovieApp can help you view and book movies conveniently.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `MovieApp` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113-T10-3/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
3. Copy the file to the directory you want to use as the home directory for your MovieApp.
4. Open your terminal / command prompt. Direct it to the folder which contains MovieApp file. Type `java -jar tp.jar` to run the app. This interface should appear if you successfully run it.
