# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of **NUSMaze**!

**NUSMaze** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based application that aims to **simplify NUS
Computer Engineering students’ journey** from one point to another within the NUS
Engineering and Computing buildings. The application allows users to find the shortest route
from one block to another, locate the nearest eatery, add personal notes to the location and
many more.

The application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands
into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can operate the application faster than other Graphical User Interface
(GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

This user guide will take you through how various features of the NUSMaze can be utilised, all
geared towards providing the best possible experience to the user.

If you are interested, jump to [Section 2 - Quick Start](#2-quick-start) to learn how to start find your way through school with **NUSMaze**.

## 3.2. Reading this document

This section introduces you to some technical terms, symbols and syntax that are used throughout the guide. You may want to
familiarize yourself with them before moving to the next section.


### 3.2.2. General Symbols and Syntax

The table below explains the general syntax used throughout the user guide.

| Syntax |  What it means |
|----------|-------------|
| `command` |  A grey highlighted block specifies a executable command that can be entered into the command box.  |
| _italics_ | Italicised text indicates that the text has a definition specific to Homerce, or it is a caption for a Figure in the guide. |
|<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: </div>  | An exclamation mark indicates that the following text is a tip. |
|<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger"> :warning: </div> | A warning sign indicates that the following text is important. |

### 3.2.3. Command Syntax and Usage

The table below explains some important technical terms to help you understand and use commands in NUSMaze.

| Technical Term | What it means |
| ---------------| --------------|
| Command Word | The first word of a command. It determines the action that NUSMaze should perform. |
| Prefix | The characters at the start of a parameter. It distinguishes one parameter from another.|
| Parameter | The word following each prefix. They are values given to a command to perform the specified action.|

**Example:** <br>
`addexp d/DESCRIPTION f/IS_FIXED v/VALUE dt/DATE [t/TAG]`

**Breakdown:**
* Command Word - `addexp` <br>
* Prefixes - `d/`, `f/`, `v/`, `dt/`, `t/`  <br>
* Parameters - `DESCRIPTION`, `IS_FIXED`, `VALUE`, `DATE`, `TAG`

The following points explain the format of a command.
More examples will be provided for each command in [Section 4 - Features](#4-features).

1. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied<br>
    - In `deletesvc s/SERVICE_CODE`, `SERVICE_CODE` is a parameter and the command can be used as `deletesvc s/SC001`.

2. Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    - `v/VALUE [t/TAG]` can be used as `v/15.00 t/equipment` or as `v/15.00`.

3. Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
    - `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/blacklist`, `t/VIP t/friend` etc.

4. Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    - If the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION dt/DATE`, `dt/DATE d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

5. A series of parameters in square brackets with asterisks indicate that only exactly one parameter among them should be specified<br>
    - If the command specifies `[t/TITLE]* [s/SERVICE_CODE]*`, `t/nail` is acceptable, but not `t/nail s/sc000` or ` ` (i.e. no parameters).

6. If the same parameter is entered multiple times within the same command, only the last entry will be used. (excludes items with `…​` after them in Point #3)
    - If `v/20.00 v/25.00` is entered, the value will be taken as 25.00.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Since Homerce is optimized for CLI-based usage, it is recommended to rely purely on CLI commands rather than using a
  mouse to navigate between the different managers of Homerce. For example, it is better to do `listapt` rather than clicking
  on the appointments tab as `listapt` will sort appointments by chronological order if there are changes made by previous commands.

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: Do I lose all my personalised routes and preferences when i close the application? <br>
**A**: Aliases, daily scheduled routes, history and notes are all stored once you exit the app and loaded upon next entry so you do not lose any data.

**Q**: How do I transfer my personalised routes and preferences to another computer? <br>
**A**: Copy the entire data folder that can be found together with the NUSMaze.jar file on the first computer and copy it over to the same directory where the NUSMaze.jar file
can be found on the second computer.
