## Introduction

Welcome to Diliveri. The ultimate smart assistant for deliverymen.
Not just the men, but the women and children too!

## Before getting started:
We know that you can't wait to dive into our application, but there are a few restrictions on our program
that we'd like you to read through and understand first!

1. Diliveri is heavily reliant on third party courier service applications (such as Grab and FoodPanda) to provide
   deliverymen with accurate location data and delivery assignments to available deliverymen. As such, for the purpose
   of implementing v2.1, running Diliveri for the first time will automatically generate files containing sample
   data that would be ordinarily generated and communicated to the Deliveryman via other delivery applications
2. These pregenerated files would ordinarily be hidden and not accessible to normal users (i.e you!). Therefore, altering
   the contents of any of these pregenerated files manually (i.e. not from the user interface) will likely result
   in the application not performing as intended, or even crashing.
3. TLDR: Please do <b>NOT</b> edit the various .txt files or the program may crash
4. As a result of Diliveri's reliance on such third parties, you'll need to run the 'start' command to load the list of deliveries into
   Diliveri before you can make the most use of Diliveri's functionalities!


## Dependencies

Diliveri will, upon initialization, generate a few .txt files. These are their respective purposes:
1. <b>Delivery.txt</b> : This file contains sample delivery data and information, including delivery
   completion status, address, delivery recipient, and the various items present in
   the delivery. The format of the items are as follows: {[item number]-[item weight]}
2. <b>profile.txt</b> : This file contains the default deliveryman profile, including name,
    vehicle model, license plate as well as the maximum tolerable weight. These can be altered
   from within Diliveri.

3. <b>routes.txt</b> : This file contains the various routes, with each location being tagged to a
    distance, as well as the corresponding delivery fee awarded upon completing a delivery at that location.
   
## Quick Start

2. Down the latest version of `Diliveri` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113-W10-1/tp/releases).
