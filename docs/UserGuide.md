## 1. Introduction

Finux is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that allows you to record your expenses, savings and loans all in
one consolidated platform. With these information made readily available at your fingertips, it will allow you to 
better adjust your expenditure or work harder towards your savings goal. Finux also includes a way for you to keep
track of the loans you have made to your friends, or the tabs for the dinners you have paid for first. 

As the Finux application is inspired entirely by the *Nix operating systems, and if you are familiar with the CLI
command interface, you will definitely enjoy the benefits of the application. You will also be able to speed up your
financial management and planning with the Finux application as compared to the traditional finance management 
applications in the market.

## 2. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `finux.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-W09-1/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
3. Copy the `finux.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* of Finux.
4. For Windows users, pull up your **Command Prompt**.\
   For Mac users, pull up your **Terminal**.\
   Navigate to the directory containing the `finux.jar` file.\
   i.e. `cd FILEPATH`, `FILEPATH` is the absolute address to the home folder of Finux.
5. Run the `finux.jar` file by executing the command `java -jar finux.jar`.

### 2.1 Understanding the guide
Now that you are here, congratulations on taking the first step to embark on your finance management journey! But before you proceed, there are a few tips and tricks that you should know in order to better understand our guide.

Throughout the guide, you will come across various symbols, each has a different meaning:

> üí°: The light bulb will precede information that may be important when using the app.

> ‚ùó: The exclamation will precede warnings for commands and inputs that may hinder your use of the app.

> üìù: The notepad will precede information that may improve the flexibility of using the app.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2 Explanation for Command formats

There are the argument types and notation used in Finux:
> * `CMD` - a valid command.
> * `-OPT` - an option, a letter preceded by a dash. E.g. `-i`.
> * `<FIELD>` - an area where data is required.
 
The Commands in Finux follow these argument orders (depending on the command):
> * `CMD -OPT <FIELD>`
> * `CMD -OPT <FIELD> -OPT <FIELD> ...`
> * `CMD <FIELD>`
> * `CMD`

---

‚ùó **Commands and options are case-sensitive**
> * E.g. `exit` will work, whereas `Exit`, `EXIT` or other variations will not be recognised.
> * E.g. `view -s` will work, but using `-S` will not be recognised as a valid option.

‚ùó **All options are single letter and followed by 1 space at the front and back**
> * E.g. `_-a_` would be a valid option format after replacing `_` with space at the front and back.  
> * E.g. `add -e Plain bread loaf -a 10` will work, whereas `add -e Plain bread loaf -a10` will not be
    recognized as valid because the input have a missing space in between `-a` and `10`.

---
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.3 Explanation for Date and Date formats

Date input is required when you specify the option `-d`.
You are required to enter a date that follows a valid date format.
Finux supports multiple date formats for ease of use such as the one listed below:
> * `DDMMYYYY`
> * `D.M.YYYY`
> * `D-M-YYYY`
> * `D/M/YYYY`
> * `YYYY.M.D`
> * `YYYY-M-D`
> * `YYYY/M/D`
>
> üìù `today` keyword specifies today's date, replacing the need for you to type in the actual date for date inputs.

### 2.4 Explanation for Expense, Loan, and Saving record output formats

The general output format used by Finux in displaying an expense and saving record is:

`[record_id] [record_type] [issue_date] [amount] description`

Whereas the general output format for loan record is:

`[record_id] [record_type] [issue_date] [amount] description [return_status]`

> * record_id
>    * record ID used to identify the record shown in the application
> * record_type
>    * A single character denoting the type of the record. 
>    * `E` for expense record, `L` for loan record and `S` for saving record.
> * issue_date
>    * Date of record supplied by the user.
> * description
>    * Description of the record supplied by the user.
> * return_status
>    * This field is only applicable to loan records.
>    * A character denoting the return status of the loan record.
>    * `[v]` for returned loan record and `[ ]` (an empty space) for unreturned loan record.

For example, lets say you bought a plain loaf of bread for $2.75 on 3rd March 2021. The output format of this *expense* record 
will be:

`[ID: 1] [E] [2021-03-03] [$2.75] Plain bread loaf`

Suppose you now make a loan of $500 to Mark on 20th March 2021 with the description being set to 
1st loan to Mark, then the output format of this *unreturned loan* record will be:

`[ID: 2] [L] [2021-03-20] [$500] 1st loan to Mark [ ]`

After Mark return this loan to you, the output format of this *returned loan* record will be:

`[ID: 2] [L] [2021-03-20] [$500] 1st loan to Mark [v]`

For the `add` and `list` commands, each displayed record will be preceded with a number, referred to as the *record ID* of
the record with respect to the combined list of expense, loan, and saving records. Let's say you have added the records
shown above to Finux one after another, then doing a `list -l` operation will display the above loan record to you as
follows:

`[ID: 2] [L] [2021-03-20] [$500] 1st loan to Mark [v]`

This means that the $500 loan you have made to Mark on 20th March 2021 has been returned and this loan is the second 
record added to Finux.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Add a record: `add`

---

> üìù For the `add` command, there is no strict ordering for options.\
> i.e. option `-a` can come before/after option `-d`.

#### 3.1.1 Add an expense record

Suppose you bought a plain loaf of bread for $2.90 on 20th March 2021, you would want to enter
your `expense` as the example shown below.

Format: `add -e <description> -a <amount> -d <date>`

Example: `add -e Plain bread loaf -a 2.90 -d 20.3.2021`

Output:

![add expense example output](img/AddExpenseExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.1.2 Add a loan record

It is the 20th of March 2021, and your friend Mark borrows a large sum of $200 from you. You will
have to enter the following into Finux to record this `loan`.

You may want to add a _description_ of the `loan`, in this scenario, it will be `1st loan to Mark`
and to include his _name_ as to keep track of Mark's `loan`.

Format: `add -l <description> -a <amount> -d <date> -p <person>`

Example: `add -l 1st loan to Mark -a 200 -d 20.3.2021 -p Mark`

Output:

![add loan example output](img/AddLoanExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.1.3 Add a saving record

Lastly, you may have saved a sum of money over the past month of March and you recorded your `saving`
on the 5th of April.

Format: `add -s <description> -a <amount> -d <date>`

Example: `add -s Savings from March -a 1000 -d 05/04/2021`

Output:

![add saving example output](img/AddSavingExampleOutput.png)

> üí° Do note that for an `expense`, you will have to use `-e` as the option. This follows for `loan` with `-l` and
> `saving` with `-s`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2 List the records details: `list`

---

#### 3.2.1 List all expense records

You may want to list all your saved expense records in Finux. By entering the `list` command
along with the `expense` option `-e`, Finux will display all your saved expenses.

Format: `list -e`

Output:

![list example output](img/ListExpenseExampleOutput.png)

#### 3.2.2 List all loan records

Likewise with listing your saved expenses, Finux is also able to list all saved loans. You will have
to use the `loan` option `-l` in this scenario.

Format: `list -l`

Output:

![list loan example output](img/ListLoanExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.2.3 List all saving records

Furthermore, all your saved savings can also be listed with the `saving` option `-s`. 

Format: `list -s`

Output:

![list saving example output](img/ListSavingExampleOutput.png)

#### 3.2.4 List all records

Lastly, you can list all of your records with the `all` option `-a`.

Format: `list -a`

Output:

![list all example output](img/ListAllExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3 View category total amount: `view`

---

#### 3.3.1 View total expenses

At this point, you may also want to `view` your total expenses incurred till now. 
So instead of listing as explained above, you would have to use the `view` command instead.

Format: `view -e`

Output:

![view expense example output](img/ViewExpenseExampleOutput.png)

#### 3.3.2 View total unreturned loans

You can also view your total **unreturned** loan using `view` and the option `-l`.

> üìù The total amount shown only includes the unreturned loans.

Format: `view -l`

Output:

![view loan example output](img/ViewLoanExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.3.3 View total savings

Your total savings can also be calculated using `view` and the option `-s`.

Format: `view -s`

Output:

![view saving example output](img/ViewSavingExampleOutput.png)

#### 3.3.4 View total amount in every category

To see the amount of each category (`expense`, `loan` and `saving`) in a summarized format,
you can use `view` and the option `-a`.

Format: `view -a`

Output:

![view all example output](img/ViewAllExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4 Mark a loan as returned: `return`

---

> üìù For the `return` command, there is no strict ordering for options.\
> i.e. option `-d` can come before/after option `-i`.

Let's say Mark returns the loan he borrowed on 20th March 2021, and his `loan` record is the second record in the 
combined list of expense, loan and saving records.
Then to mark this loan as *returned*, the `record_id` to be included in this case is `2` and the `return_date` is 
the date of return which is `28/03/21`.

Format: `return -i <record_id> -d <return_date>`
* `<record_id>` refers to the record_ID displayed in the [list command output](#322-list-all-loan-records).
* `<return_date>` refers to the date on which the borrower has returned the loan.

Example: `return -i 2 -d 28/03/2021`

Output:

![return example output](img/ReturnExampleOutput.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5 Remove a record: `remove`

---

In a scenario that you realised that the `expense` record of Plain bread loaf added on 20th March 2021 was wrong,
you can `remove` the record by entering the `remove` command with the _record ID_ of the `expense`, 
this is case, it would be `1`.

Format: `remove -i <record_id>`
* `<record_id>` refer to the record ID displayed in list command.

Example: `remove -i 1`

Output:

![remove example output](img/RemoveExampleOutput.png)

> üí° To find the record ID of a record, you can simply `list` the record type (`-e`, `-l`, `-s`, `-a`) and the number that
> precedes the record is the record ID.
>  
> üí° After removing a record from the application, you will have to use the list command again to retrieve the latest 
> updated record IDs.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.6 Check a person's credit score: `creditscore`

---

Let's say that Mark wants to borrow money from you again, but you will want to know his "credit-worthiness" 
before lending him money again, you can simply enter his _name_ after the `creditScore` command.

Format: `creditscore <person>`

* `<person>` refers to any person including those in the list and not in the list.
* `<person>` is case-insensitive, e.g. `jason` is the same as `Jason`

Example: `creditscore mark`

Output:

![creditscore example output](img/CreditScoreExampleOutput.png)

> üìù As of version 2.1, a score of `5` will be added if returned within a week, `10`, `20` and `50` will be deducted
> when a loan is returned after one week and before the second week, two weeks and before the fourth week and 
> after four weeks respectively.

> üí° A credit score of `100` will be shown from a person who has not borrowed money from you as they can still
> considered trustworthy. The Finux application will display a credit score of `100` for people whom you have not added 
> any loans prior.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.7 Exit the program: `exit`

---

You can exit the application by typing the `exit` command.

Format: `exit`

Output:

![exit example output](img/ExitExampleOutput.png)

### 3.8 Help function: `help`

> No. `view -l` only shows the total amount of unreturned loans.

**Q3**: What happens if Finux crashes unexpectedly? <br>
> All records are saved upon addition, deletion, or returned. Hence chances of data losses are minimized.

**Q4**: Finux keeps having a `bad init` error message, but it is my first time launching Finux. <br>
> Do check and ensure that Finux has the proper write permissions in the directory.
