## <a id="faq">FAQ</a>

**Q**: Do I need to create a new project before adding resource to it?

>No, you do not need to do so. With `add` command, if the provided project name is not found in the project list, 
a new project will be created, and the provided resources will be added to the newly created project automatically.

**Q**: Can I add a resource to a project without providing description?

>Yes, you can. It is because description is optional when adding a resource with `add` command.
