# wjchoi0712 - Project Portfolio Page for NUSMaze

## Overview
**NUSMaze** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based application that aims to **simplify NUS Computer Engineering students’ journey** from one point to another within the NUS Engineering and Computing buildings.
The application allows users to find the shortest route from one block to another, locate the nearest eatery, add personal notes to the location and many more.
The main target audience of NUSMaze are freshmen who are unfamiliar with the campus and need help travelling between Engineering and computing.
