## Overview

Patient Manager is a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) application for **_general practitioners_** (GP)
who work in polyclinics to manage their patient list.

My teammates and I developed this application as a team project for CS2113T. This project
aims to develop a program that solves a problem using Java.

The development cycle, excluding the planning stage which began a few weeks before actual development, consists
of three iterations. In v1.0, we delivered the minimum viable product, and in v2.0, we continued to add features to our
application. For v2.1, the last iteration, we focused on bug fixing and making improvements in product documentation.
