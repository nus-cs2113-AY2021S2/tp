## Overview
This is a student project for university software development course. I am one of the contributors to the FridgeFriend project.

## Project: FridgeFriend

FridgeFriend is an app for managing food in the fridge, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, FridgeFriend can track your cold or frozen groceries faster and easier than any other apps.
It is written in Java, and has more than 5500 lines of code.


## Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project:

`v1.0 tasks`: In charge of implementing the skeletal version of FridgeFriend.

`v2.0 tasks`: Convert Food category into classes, Added History Command, Added List by Storage Location Command,
as well as associated JUnit tests and helper function code.

`v2.1 tasks`: Feature enhancements by fixing bugs in the application.

**Code contributed**: More than 1300 lines of code: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=leeyp)
