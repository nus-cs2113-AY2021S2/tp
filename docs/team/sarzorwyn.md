## PROJECT: Control Your Crowd

## Overview
Control Your Crowd (CYC) is a desktop application used for managing crowd levels at any location or events.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is written in Java using the
Object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and has about 5 kLoc.

## Summary of contributions
* **New feature**: Added the ability to store the list.
  * What it does: Allow the user to not have to retype all the persons into the
    program again
  * Justification: This feature improves on the product significantly as a user
    can recover from unexpected crashes without having to input all the data again.
    This also allows the user to transfer data from a computer to another.
  * Highlights: This enhancement has to be kept up to date with the attributes of other classes.
  * Credits: AB2 address book storage implementation for regex
* **New feature**: Added the ability to store persistent configurations
  * What it does: The user can set program settings that will be stored
  * Justification: The settings should persist to fit the user preferences.
  * Highlights: Editing the file could lead to severe program malfunction and is hard to recover from.
* **Enhancement**: Added the command to move storage location
  * What it does: Allow the user to move the storage to a new location
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to easily create multiple new nested folder
  * Highlights: This enhancement does not extend to the config file as the program would not
  where to read the main storage from
