## Overview
Patient Manager is a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) application for **_general practitioners_** (GP)
who work in polyclinics to manage their patient list.

I, together with my teammates, developed this application as a team project for the CS2113T module in NUS.
This project aimed to develop a program targeting a current problem using Java with Object-oriented
programming as the model.

The entire development cycle, excluding the planning stage which consists of a few weeks before actual
development, includes three iterations. Iteration v1.0 is the minimum viable product, and v2.0 is the 
one with most of the features in. For v2.1, the last iteration, we focused on bug fixing and improvements
in product documentation.

### Enhancement Implemented

* Drafted overall structure of the program. This includes the organization and placeholders
  of command classes, Parser, models, UI class, etc.
* `command.Command` class — This is the parent class for all commands that enforce some common constraints.
* `Parser` class — This class handles the parsing and initializing of command classes.
* `Data` class, and model classes like `Patient` and `Record` classes — These classes are in charge of the data
  storage and manipulation of the application.
* Migration of exception handling from using the generic `Exception` to the custom classes, such as
  `InvalidInputException`. This includes the drafting of `BaseException` class.
* Restructured the main class `PatientManager` to be more OOP.
* Added `current` command for printing out the current patient being loaded.
* Integrated `Storage` into various command classes.
* Other generic bug fixes for the entire project. This includes bug reported by peer teams during PE-D.
