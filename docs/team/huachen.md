## Overview

It is a revolutionary app that not only provides an organised user-friendly database, but provides customisable categories to enhance your experience. Through its intuitive command line interface, you will be able to store and access your reviews & recommendation easily.

#### Basic features implemented
* Ui and Messages class
    * These classes help to compartmentalize the interactions with the user. 
    * Prepares for the future possiblity of implementing GUI, where the output may not be to the terminal. 
* Sorting feature
    * Sorting is a key feature of the reviews mode
    * There are currently 5 methods by which the user can sort their reviews, and each of them have their custom comparator created for the Review object. 
#### Enhancements implemented
* Convert text storage to JSON format
    * Using text to store data could work, but it is very easy to corrupt, especially when all types of characters are allowed in our data. 
    * JSON simplifies this by acting like a dictionary, where we can store data as arrays directly to a keyword. 
* Add price range field to recommendations
* Implement dynamic formatting for whitespace
    * Since we want to display our data in a graphical table, the border characters cannot be hard-coded as they will vary in position with the length of the data. 
    * Implementing a function to calculate the number of whitespaces to append before the border helps dynamically adjust this. 
    * For viewing full reviews, it is natural for the review to be full paragraphs and thus it will exceed the length of the box. Thus, I also implemented a function to split the description field into multiple lines. 
* QOL improvement to allow reattempts after invalid input
    * Before, invalid inputs will be rejected and the user will have to restart their action from the beginning. With this feature, they can simply correct their input and continue with their action, without having to lose their progress. 
* Change display type feature
    * This feature allows the app to use asterisks instead of stars to display ratings, as some users have terminals which have non-monospaced fonts or are unable to parse unicode symbols. 
    * Asterisks are treated as normal characters and are a good workaround to this problem, and this setting can be saved in storage so that they do not need to change this setting everytime the application is restarted. 
    * When the user is somehow able to view the stars after upgrades or reconfigurations, they can easily switch the display type back to stars to fully appreciate the experience.
