## Overview

```FastScheduler (FS)``` is a desktop app for restaurant managers to schedule employees for work, optimised for use via
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast
and prefer typing, FS can help you manage the schedules of employees and shifts faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are details of my contributions to the project.

### Contributions to coding

---
#### Implemented most features under the `employee` package as shown below:

* `Employee` class
    * Defined all variables in the class(`name`, `schedules`, all other constants).
    * Created the class constructor(`Employee`) and all get/set methods (`getName`, `setName`, `getSchedules`).
    * Created `addSchedule` to add a new schedule for an employee to the system (handles internal logic).
    * Created `dropSchedule` to drop an existing schedule from an employee (handles internal logic).
    * Created `isScheduleValid` to ensure the schedule entered is in a valid format.
    * Created `isInteger` for variable checking within the class.

*Justification:* This `Employee` Class is essential because our entire APP is about managing an employee's 
schedules and shifts. Hence, each employee must be defined clearly through his/her own attributes.
Also, the `addSchedule`, `dropSchedule`, `isScheduleValid` methods are needed to define the internal behaviours
of the class, such as what is the format of a valid schedule.

---
* `EmployeeController` class
    * Created `addEmployee` to add a new employee to the system.
    * Created `addSchedule` to add a new schedule for an employee to the system (handles external logic).
    * Created `dropSchedule` to drop an existing schedule from an employee (handles external logic).
    * Created `getEmployeeObjectByName` to return an `Employee` based on a name.
    * Created `isEmployeeDuplicate` and `isScheduleDuplicate` to prevent a duplicated employee or schedule from being added to the system.

*Justification:* `EmployeeController` aims to make our code more OOP by handling the logic between an user and his interaction with an 
employee

---
### Implemented the `Ui` class and all its methods
* `printWelcomeMessage`
* `printExitMessage`
* `printHelpMessage`
* `printInvalidScheduleFeedbackMessage`

*Justification:* `Ui` aims to make our code more OOP by taking the responsibility to hold important messages to be displayed to an user.

---
### Built the overall structure of the `AppController` class, and contributed to its final implementation.

Below are the structures/ideas that I came up with for `AppController`:
* The class holds the common variables to be used by all programmers (eg. `employees`, `shifts`)
* The class interacts with the user and passes control to other parts of the program by using 'while' and 'switch' 
statements.

*Justification:* This feature aims to make the code more OOP by serving as a platform that interacts with an user, 
identifies his commands and passes responsibility to other relevant parts of the program

### Contributions to documentation

#### User Guide

Features I wrote in the final version:
* Add an employee: add employee
* Add new employee’s schedules: add schedule
* Drop existing employee’s schedules: drop schedule

Other joint contributions to our google doc (outdated version):
* user stories
* command summary

### Contributions to DG

* Under Implementation, I wrote the section titled 'add schedule to employee feature', which includes:
  * A brief overview of the Employee Class, along with a simple class diagram titled 'employee class diagram v2'
  * A detail explanation of our addSchedule feature, along with a detail sequence diagram
  titled 'add schedule sequence diagram v2'

### Contributions to team-based tasks

* Contributed to bug finding and fixing
* Creating and releasing of all jar files (Resolved the frequently appearing 
  bug on "no main manifest attribute" when launching
  the jar file with the help of external resources)
* Setting up github team and repo
* Clarifying tp doubts on behalf of the group
