## Jia Hui - Project Portfolio Page

### Overview

I am part of a 4-member team enrolled in the module, CS2113T. We are tasked to design and implement a Command Line
Interface (CLI) program. The name of our programme is **Connoisseur**.

#### Overview of Project

Connoisseur is a one-stop application designed for university students. It allows the user to create and store both
reviews of experiences, and things they wish to experience. With a clean and simple interface, the user would be able to
record and retrieve a consolidated list of their experiences easily, keeping their data organised and up-to-date.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project, which includes coding, documenting and other helpful contributions in
