## Project: HealthVault
HealthVault is a desktop application made for healthcare workers as their one stop application for recording and accessing critical patient or staff information. It is optimized for the Command Line Interface, where an experienced typist will be able to make full use of the informative and minimalistic GUI to achieve significant gains in efficiency

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature**: Developed the Patient Menu and its various functionalities.
  - What it does: Provides the functionality of adding/deleting/listing/finding Patients.
  - Justification: Being able to store and access critical patient information will allow healthcare workers to minimize time spent on these administrative activities.
  - Highlights: The find functionality implemented allows for comparisons to be made without case-sensitivity. This allows for faster and more flexible searching.
    

- **New Feature**: Developed the Patient storage.
  - What it does: Provides the functionality of saving the existing patient details to text format.
  - Justification: Having the data in a portable format which is a text file will allow nurses to work on multiple computers as long as the computer has the application installed, and the nurse possesses the text file containing the details.
  - Highlights: The application does rigorous testing for corruption of the data files, hence tampering with the files and corrupting the data will be caught by the program.
    

- **New Feature**: Developed the handler (Start Menu) that allows running a separate instance within the main program instance.
  - What it does: Allows there to be clear instance separation between groups of classes that handle different features.
  - Justification: Users and developers now have a specific instance in which certain commands relating to a specific area of the application can be accessed from, increasing the organization level of the application.
  - Highlights: The Start Menu has a help function that allows users to get an overview of what each feature does.
