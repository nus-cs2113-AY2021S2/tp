### Project: ModMan
Short for Module Manager, ModMan is a desktop app designed to help teaching assistants manage their module(s).
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
ModMan helps to track module details as well as studentsâ€™ progress and data, all in one platform.
It can also perform autograding for MCQ assignments.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


- **New Feature**: Added the ability to keep track of module lessons within the app.
    - What it does: Allows the user to add, view, edit, and delete lessons based on type, location, day, start time and end time.
    - Justification: Timetable tracking is one of the biggest issues for TAs who do not have a fast and convenient platform to check their module schedule.


- **New Feature**: Added the ability to keep track of multiple modules and select a current module to work in.
    - What it does: Add modules that user is teaching to a list. List all modules or select an individual module to work in.
    - Justification: TAs may need to track information and work for multiple modules. Separating these modules makes functions clearer and more focused.
    

- **Enhancements to existing features**:
    - Implemented the main `Modman` class that structures the high-level logic of the app: #15

    - Implemented input validation for empty or whitespace parameters across commands in `Parser` class: #241, #245, #248
