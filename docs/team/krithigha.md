## Krithigha Panneer - Project Portfolio Page

### Overview

I am part of a 4-member team enrolled in the module, CS2113T. We are tasked to design and implement a Command Line
Interface (CLI) program. The name of our programme is **Connoisseur**.

#### Overview of Project

Connoisseur is a one-stop application designed for university students. It allows the user to create and store both
reviews of experiences, and things they wish to experience next. With a clean and simple interface, the user would be able to
record and retrieve a consolidated list of their experiences easily, keeping their data organised and up-to-date.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project, which includes coding, creating issues, reviewing & merging approved pull requests on Github,
documenting and other helpful contributions in the process of developing Connoisseur. I also played an important role in identifying the current
problem area of disorganised lists on experiences university students make and proposed the solution "Connoisseur". I aided in brainstorming user
stories and conceptualising how V1.0 and subsequent versions will look like.

#### Enhancements implemented:

* Coded the [Review class](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/7) to create review objects which was a crucial foundation to the rest of the project and code.
* Implemented the [Date & Time of entry](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/26) attribute for a review object.
* Implemented the [View](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/28) method of ReviewList class.
* Implemented the [Check for duplicate title in the list](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/37) method of ReviewList & RecommendationList class. This method was important as it fixed bugs when implementing other methods such as delete & view.
* Implemented the [edit](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/45) method of ReviewList class & RecommendationList class. This enhancement was important as it improved user-experience and enabled the user to edit erroneous info they accidentally input. This edit feature introduced some bugs into the program as it enabled duplicate review/recommendation titles to be input. 
  I Implemented the [check for duplicates in the list while editing](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/143/files) method to ReviewList class & RecommendationList class to fix this bug and ensure the completeness of the feature.
* Implemented [borders](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/68/files) when viewing the list of reviews and recommendation. This feature considerably enhanced the look and aesthetic of Connoisseur. Which was important to appeal to the target audience of university students. 
  Instead of merely hardcoding the borders, I ensured that it takes into account character length of the attributes of review & recommendation objects so that the feature was complete and bug free.
* Resolved issues and [fixed bugs](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pull/123) raised by others during PE dry run which

#### Contributions to documentation

* User Guide
    * I contributed to the majority of the UG content. From [section 1](https://ay2021s2-cs2113t-f08-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#1-introduction) to [section 4.2.5](https://ay2021s2-cs2113t-f08-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#425-review-a-recommendation)
    * Included updated code snippets that reflect V2.1 and added in important additional information for each section the user needs to take note of.
* Developer Guide
  * Wrote the table of contents and sections to be included in the DG. This facilitated the allocation of workload amongst team members as we were able to split the sections to work on easily.
  * Contributed Sequence diagram and content for [sections 4](https://ay2021s2-cs2113t-f08-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#4-implementation) to [4.2.6.](https://ay2021s2-cs2113t-f08-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#426-delete-a-review-feature)

#### Contributions to team-based tasks :

* Reviewed teammates PRs, approved and merged PRs which can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/pulls?q=reviewed-by%3AKrithigha24)
* Created and assigned issues to team members which can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-F08-3/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+author%3AKrithigha24)
* I helped conceptualise the recommendation class in v2.0 and how it links to the review class.

### Contributions beyond the project team:
