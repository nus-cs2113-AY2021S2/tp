## Overview
Welcome to Movie App. This application is developed by me and my teammates in CS2113 group T10-3!
The function of the application is to facilitate users – both admin and customer – to see movies and book a ticket.
We have several functions catered to your movie-craving, like seeing a movie review and give a rating.
