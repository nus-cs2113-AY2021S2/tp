## Overview

Patient Manager is a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) application for **_general practitioners_** (GP)
who work in polyclinics to manage their patient list.

I, together with my teammates, developed this application as a team project for CS2113T module of NUS. This project
aimed to develop a program targeting a current problem using Java the Object-Oriented paradigm.

The entire development cycle, excluding the planning stage which began a few weeks before actual development, consists
of three iterations. In v1.0, we delivered the minimum viable product, and in v2.0, we continued to add features to our
application. For v2.1, the last iteration, we focused on bug fixing and making improvements in product documentation.
