## Overview

```FastScheduler (FS)``` is a desktop app for restaurant managers to schedule employees for work, optimised for use via
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast
and prefer typing, FS can help you manage the schedules of employees and shifts faster than traditional GUI apps.

___
Given below are details of my contributions to the project.

### Enhancements implemented
Implemented most viewing shift functionalities. 

### Contributions to documentation:
For the user guide, we initially did it on google docs, before editing it and shifting it over to our git file.
I implemented the feature descriptions, and how to use each feature. 

For the UG in the docs, I described our app and its functionality.

### Contribution to DG
Described the viewing shift functionalities and the UML diagram there. 

### Review/mentoring contributions
I suggested how we should move our codes around, as it was initially all in app controller.
I also tried to link the shift and employees together, such that when the employee was dropped, they would be dropped from the shift that they were assigned too as well.
