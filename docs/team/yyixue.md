## Project: TraceYourProj

### Overview
TraceYourProj is a desktop app for tracking online resources for data science projects, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an exit command
    * What it does: allows the user to exit TraceYourProj when they are done managing their resources.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may not always need to have the app running or unecessarily using computer resources.
    
* **New Feature**: Added a find command
    * What it does: allows the user to find specific resources related to an input keyword.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may not want to look through
    his entire list of resources in each project to find a specific resource. This find command makes it more convenient 
      and quicker to find the desired resource.

* Wrote JUnit tests for code related to exiting and finding functions
