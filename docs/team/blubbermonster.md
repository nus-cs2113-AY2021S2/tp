## Overview
UniTrack is a one-stop university tracker designed and created to help NUS students keep track of all the resources needed for their modules.
It also includes helpful features such as a CAP simulator and a task manager. The user can interact with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
UniTracker was created with Java, and has about 7 kLOC.

### Summary of Contributions

**Features:** Implemented the Links feature.
- What it does: Allows the user to add, delete and view external links and their zoom links. 
- Justification: This feature helps the user keep track of their links by putting it in one convenient location.
- Highlights: The zoom links are also tagged to their module codes and can be viewed on the ModuleInfo menu under `View A Module`
- Credits: To check for a valid URL in isValidLink in the class LinkInfo, I reused a piece of code from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-an-url-is-valid-or-not-using-regular-expression/
