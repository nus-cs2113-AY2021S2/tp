## Overview

`iGraduate` is a command line application that acts as a centralised hub for NUS students
majoring in Information Security to plan their academic journey. With tools like the
storing of modules, listing of modules that can be taken, an academic progression indicator
and a CAP calculator, iGraduate will help students check his/her graduation progress, view modules
taken based on programme requirements and make informed decisions about future modules.

### Enhancements implemented:

#### Implemented `AddCommand` class of iGraduate with [Ke Wen](https://github.com/kewenlok)

The AddCommand class is responsible for executing the `add` command, and takes in additional parameters, module name,
module code, module type, number of MCs and/or prerequisites. The AddCommand class helps the users to add their 
modules into the module list.

*Considerations*

The `add` command is important to iGraduate because we want to give the users freedom to plan what modules to take, 
instead of giving them a study plan in-built by our team. Therefore, we decided to allow users to add modules on their own 
as long as the module details are entered correctly and that they have cleared all prerequisites.

#### Implemented `CapCommand` class of iGraduate

The CapCommand class is responsible for executing the `cap` command, which helps to display the user's current CAP 
and degree classification.

*Considerations*

The `cap` Command is important to iGraduate because our app's focus is to help user's easily access their academic 
records and all details regarding it. Hence, we decided to show both the CAP score and degree classification with the 
`cap` command.

### Contributions to documentation

#### User Guide

For the user guide, I made some minor edits to improve grammar, correct spelling and improve the phrasing of the guide to be more
audience-centric and beginner-friendly.

### Contributions to DG

For the <b>Design</b> and <b>Implementation</b> sections of the DG, I contributed to the command component as well as
some diagrams in the DG, namely the AddCommand class diagram and the delete command sequence diagram. 
I used PlantUML to create the diagrams. For the <b>Product Scope</b> section of the DG, I contributed by writing 
the target user profile and value proposition 
component of the section. I also wrote the <b>Non-Functional Requirements</b> section of the and the 
<b>Instructions for manual testing</b> section of the DG, by giving positive and negative test cases 
for the commands in iGraduate, as well as the expected output in the application.

### Contributions to team-based tasks

I helped to write non-feature specific portions of the UG and DG such as the <b>Product Scope</b> and
<b>Instructions for manual testing</b> sections of the DG. I also helped to create some user stories and assign issues
to my group mates as well as myself. Lastly helped to fix some bugs and gave inputs to the discussions in the team.
