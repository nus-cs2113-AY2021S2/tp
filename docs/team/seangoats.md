## Project: TraceYourProj

### Overview
TraceYourProj is a quick and simple application for tracking online resources for data science projects,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Code Contribution:

* **Feature 1**: Added the help command.
    * <i>What it does</i> : Allows user to view the available commands and their formats.
    * <i>Justification</i> : This will allow first-time user to easily know the commands available and their formats,
    this will allow for ease of usage due to reduced need for memorisation by the user.


* **Feature 2**: Added the save command.
    * <i>What it does</i> : Allows user to save the projects and resources currently added in the current session to a storage text file.
      
* **Feature 3**: Added the load command.
    * <i>What it does</i> : Allows the user to load the projects and resources that are saved in the storage text file. Works hand
    in hand with the save command.
    * <i>Justification</i> : The save and load features together improves the product significantly because they allow re-usability. The user will be able to  keep track
      the projects they have added in the current session in future sessions. The way that they are implemented also give the user freedom of choice whether to make use of them as
      they have to be explicity called to be invoked.
    


* Wrote JUnit tests for methods related in the `Resource` and `Project` classes.

* Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=seangoats&tabRepo=AY2021S2-CS2113-W10-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* Reviewed PRs and helped to fix bugs.

#### Documentation:

* Added instructions for using the `save` and `load` commands.

<i>Developers Guide</i>
* Added a short introduction of the application.
* Added the explanation for implementation methods of `save` and `load`.

UML diagrams:
* Sequence diagram for `save` and `load` features.
* Overarching class diagram of application.
