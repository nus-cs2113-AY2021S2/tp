### Contribution to Implementation

#### Record, Loan, Expense classes

I was tasked to do up these simple yet foundational building blocks of our application. I was working with Gerard where
he worked on the remaining building block classes Saving and RecordList. We worked on them as soon as possible as it is
really crucial for other parts of the application where testing requires these classes.

#### Validators

Along with Andy and Mark, we have introduced several validators to validate inputs and parameters to make sure that the
values are in the correct format before being utilized. I was responsible for the `validateIndex` to make sure that the
indices given are not symbols, alphabets, negative numbers, unknown symbols, etc.

#### RemoveCommand

This command was partially done and I included some of my own implementations for better usability. This command is 
used hand in hand with the `validateIndex` and hence I took up this.

### Contributions to UG

* My groupmate Andy has designed the UG skeleton with reference to my 
[individual Project(iP)](https://tzexern.github.io/ip/) User Guide.
* Tasked to finish the `3.5 remove`, `3.6 creditscore` and `3.7 exit` under our `3. Features` section.
* Taken all the screenshots used in our UG and updated them whenever necessary.

### Contributions to DG

* I have provided my team with an improved version of DG skeleton building on top of Mark's. These include proper headers
and hyperlinks after we have finalized our rough template for DG. 
* I'm also tasked to complete several subsections of the DG, these include:
  * `Introduction`, `Setting Up`, `UI Component` under `Design`, `Remove Feature` under `Implementation`, 
    `Appendix B: User Stories`, `Appendix C: Non-Functional Requirements`, `Appendix D: Instructions for Manual Testing` 
    was done together by me and Jonah
