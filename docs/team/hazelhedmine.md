### Overview

UniTracker is a one-stop university tracker designed and created to help NUS students keep track of all the resources needed for their modules. 
It also includes helpful features such as a CAP simulator and a task manager. The user can interact with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
UniTracker was created with Java, and has about 7 kLOC.

### Summary of Contributions

**Features:** Implemented the Task Manager feature.
- What it does: Allows the user to add, mark or unmark, delete, view and pin tasks. Tasks are categorized as normal tasks, assignments, midterms or final exams.
- Justification: This feature helps the user to keep track of their tasks and exams for their modules in NUS, improving their quality of life as a NUS student.
- Highlights: This feature is integrated with the Module Information feature such that tasks will belong to modules. It also required in-depth analysis of user needs to create an intuitive and effective user interface. It was challenging to implement the pinned task feature as it required proper understanding of data structures for it to be accurate and efficient. 
- Credits: This feature was derived and enhanced from the Individual Project completed in the first half of the NUS module CS2113T (software engineering and object orientated programming).
