## Project Overview: Healthier

**Healthier** is a cross-platform desktop application developed using `Java SE 11`, which is used for health and fitness
data management.  
It targets people who care about fitness, who exercise regularly (at least 3 times/week) and have diet plans. It is
designed for users of age group 18-30.  
The app is used via **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. If the user is proficient in using command-line tools & typing,
then it could be very efficient to use. This app also provides several shortcut commands for advanced users for further
efficient operations.

### Features implemented

1. Implemented `Help` to enable help command.
    * This feature allows the user to learn the syntax for all commands available.
1. Implemented `Add records for exercise, sleep, diet, and bodyweight` feature.
    * This feature allows the user to:
        * Add one exercise record with workout activity, duration and date (optional).
        * Add one diet record with food category, food weight and date (optional).
        * Add one sleep record with duration and date (optional).
        * Add one body weight record with current body weight and date (optional).
1. Implemented `View records` feature.
    * This feature allows the user to view existing records of `exercise`, `sleep`, `diet`, and `bodyweight`.
    * The displayed result can be filtered by specifying optional parameters.
1. Implemented `Delete records` feature.
    * This feature allows the user to delete an existing record of `exercise`, `sleep`, `diet`, and `bodyweight`.
1. Implemented `Set daily/weekly goals for exercise, sleep, diet, and bodyweight` feature.
    * This feature allows the user to:
        * Set a daily/weekly exercise goal with a target energy (in calories) to burn.
        * Set a daily/weekly sleep goal with a target duration (in hours).
        * Set a daily/weekly diet goal with a target energy (in calories) to take in.
        * Set a daily/weekly body weight goal with a target weight (in kg).
1. Implemented `Check daily/weekly goals` feature.
    * This feature allows the user to check the current progress of goals set by the user.
1. Implemented `Cancel existing goals` feature.
    * This feature allows the user to cancel a goal set by the user.
1. Implemented `Time Controller` to manage the system time which is essential for updating the progress of daily/weekly
   goals.
    * This functionality sets a local time for the app, which is used for loading the goal objects from the data files &
      updating the corresponding progress of each goal.
    * This functionality allows the automatic initialization & update of the daily/weekly progress for goals.

### Enhancements to existing features

* Regularly optimized the overall code quality by refactoring, resolving potential errors, and improving the code
  design.
    * This ensures that the code has better readability and comply with
      the [Java Coding Standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/basic.html).
