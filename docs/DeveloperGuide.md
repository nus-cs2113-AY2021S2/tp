## **Design**
### Project-Overview
NusFoodReviews is a application that is built using Java. It has cross-platform ability and is able to run on MAC-OS, 
Windows and Linux. When run, NusFoodReviews allows user to view selected canteens, stores with their menus, reviews and ratings. In addition,
user is able to leave reviews and ratings to the stores. On the other hand the user can choose to run as admin, and the
password is `Password`. When run as admin the user is able to `add` or `remove` canteens, stores, menu and reviews. These admin
functions allows the app to be moderated and maintained by the person in charge. 

### Architecture
![architecture diagram](./img/architecture%20diagram.png)

The Architecture Diagram shown above explains the high-level design of NusFoodReviews Application. The following is a brief overview of each component.

`Main` is responsible for,
+ At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
+ At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

`Resources` contains the bundled resource(database file) of the application. When user run the application for the first time, 
it will read from this resource and copy it to the local machine. Return user will not need to read from this resource anymore. 

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
  

  
The rest of the App consists of four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App. 
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the In-App memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from text file, and write to text file. 

### UI-Component

### Logic-Component

### Model-Component
![Model Class Diagram](./img/ModelClassDiagram.png)

Our model consists of four classes: Canteen, Store, Menu, and Review.
Composition relationships exist between these classes. 
For example, when a Canteen is deleted, all Stores, Menus and Reviews will also be deleted.

### Storage-Component
![Storage Class Diagram](./img/storage%20CD.png)

The `Storage` component,
* For new user, will first create a new directory and text file.
* Next, will load the data from resource and write it into the newly created text file.
* At the same time, it will also load into the in-app data.
* If it is an existing user, it will only loads data from the text file into in-App data.


## **Implementation** 
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

There are 2 types of user :
+ [**`Public User`**](#public-user)
+ [**`Admin User`**](#admin-user)

### Main
![Main Sequence Diagram](./img/Main.png)

When the application is launched, an Ui object and Parser object is instantiated.
To instantiate the Parser object, the main NusFoodReviews and Ui object is passed.


### Public User
For public users, the list of commands is shown below:

* Display selected store sample menu: [**`menu`**](#display-menu) 
* Display all reviews of the selected store : [**`reviews`**](#display-reviews)
* Add a new review of the selected store: [**`add`**](#add-reviews)
* Goes back to home page to select canteen: [**`home`**](#home)
* Display all the stores of the selected canteen: [**`list`**](#list)
* Goes back to login page: `login` (not worthy)
* Exiting the application: `exit`(not worthy)

### Display Menu

![DisplayMenus Sequence Diagram](./img/DisplayMenus.png)

To display menus, `DisplayMenusCommand.execute()` is called, passing in
an ArrayList of canteens and the Ui object instantiated in NusFoodReviews.

When DisplayMenusCommand was first instantiated, the relevant Store object was passed
into the constructor. `DisplayMenusCommand.execute()` will then call `getMenus()` on the
store object to get an ArrayList of menus, before passing the ArrayList to the ui object
to be displayed by calling `Ui#showDisplayMenu()`.



### Display Reviews

![ReadReviews Sequence Diagram](./img/ReadReviews.png)

To read reviews, `ReadReviewsCommand.execute()` is called passing in an ArrayList of
canteens and the Ui object instantiated in nusFoodReviews.

When ReadReviewsCommand was first instantiated, the relevant Store object was passed
into the constructor. `ReadReviewsCommand.execute()` will then call `getReviews()` on the
store object to get an ArrayList of reviews, then calling `getAverageRating()` to get the
average rating of the store. After that, `getStoreName()` is also called to get the store
name of the store. These parameters are then passed to the ui object to be displayed by calling
`Ui.showReviews()`



### Add Reviews
![AddReviews Sequence Diagram](./img/AddReviews.png)

To add reviews, `AddReviewCommand.execute()` is called passing in an ArrayList of
canteens and the Ui object instantiated in nusFoodReviews.

`AddReviewCommand.execute()` will then call `getReviewFromUser(ui)` to get the description and rating. Next, it will 
then create a new review object and add it into Store by calling `store.addReview(Review)`. Lastly, it will call
`saveReview((filepath,true),canteen,store,description,rating,dateTime)` by instantiating the class `WriteToFile` to 
save the new review into the text file database.

### Home 
![Home Sequence Diagram](./img/HomeCommand.png)

To reset the store and canteen index in nusFoodReviews, `HomeCommand#execute()` is called,
passing in an ArrayList of canteens, and the ui object instantiated in NusFoodReviews.

When `HomeCommand` is first called, we pass the main NusFoodReviews object to the
constructor. This allows the `Command` to interact with the main object when `execute` is called.


### List
![DisplayStore Sequence Diagram](./img/DisplayStores.png)

To see the list of stores in a canteen, `DisplayStoreCommand.execute()` is called passing in an ArrayList of
canteens and the Ui object instantiated in nusFoodReviews.

First thing, if canteen size is 0 the command will be ended telling the user that there is no canteen no view.
Next, if there are canteens available then user will choose one of the canteen by calling `NusFoodReviews.setCanteenIndex`.
After choosing it will call `nusFoodReviews.getCanteenIndex()` to get the canteen's index to view its stores. If canteen's
index is -1, it means that user input is cancel and it will return from that function. Lastly, `ui.showDisplayStores(canteens.get(currentCanteenIndex))` 
will be called to display the list of stores in the chosen canteen.

### Admin User

For an admin user, the list of commands is shown below:

* View canteens [**`1`**](#view-canteens)
* Add canteen [**`2`**](#add-canteen)
* Add a store in a canteen [**`3`**](#add-store)
* Add Menu to a store [**`4`**](#add-menu)
* Delete canteen [**`5`**](#delete-canteen)
* Delete a store in a canteen [**`6`**](#delete-store)
* Delete reviews in a store [**`7`**](#delete-review)
* Delete menu in a store [**`8`**](#delete-menu)
* View stores in a canteen [**`9`**](#view-stores)
* Exit [**`0`**](#exit)

### Run as admin
![Admin Sequence Diagram](./img/Admin.png)

Once admin is verified in NusFoodReviews, The program will start asking for inputs and `Parser#parseAdminCommand()` will be
taking in these input and create commands object for admin user to execute. 


### View Canteens
![DisplayCanteens Sequence Diagram](./img/DisplayCanteens.png)

To see the list of canteens, `DisplayCanteensCommand.execute()` is called passing in an ArrayList of
canteens and the Ui object instantiated in nusFoodReviews.

It will then call `ui.ShowDisplayCanteens(canteens)` by passing over the arraylist of canteens.


### Reset Store Feature
![DisplayMenus Sequence Diagram](./img/ResetStore.png)

To reset the store index in nusFoodReviews, `ResetStoreCommand#execute()` is called, 
passing in an ArrayList of canteens, and the ui object instantiated in NusFoodReviews.

When `ResetStoreCommand` is first called, we pass the main NusFoodReviews object to the 
constructor. This allows the `Command` to interact with the main object when `execute` is called.




### [Admin] Add Canteen
![AddCanteen Sequence Diagram](./img/AddCanteen.png)

To add a canteen, `AddCanteenCommand#execute()` is called, passing in
an ArrayList of canteens and the Ui object instantiated in NusFoodReviews.

`Ui#showAddCanteen()` is called to display the add canteen prompt.
The program will then wait for user input, looping continuously if a valid Canteen name is not entered.
Invalid names include: existing canteen names.
If the user inputs 'cancel', the loop is exited and the program returns from `AddCanteenCommand`.

Once a valid CanteenName is entered, a new Canteen object is instantiated and added to the ArrayList of canteens.
`Ui#showAddCanteenSuccess()` is then called to display canteen added confirmation.

Additionally, the static method `WriteToFile#saveCanteen()` is called to update the canteen in storage.

### [Admin] Delete Canteen
#### Implementation
![DeleteCanteen Sequence Diagram](./img/DeleteCanteen.png)

To delete a canteen, `DeleteCanteenCommand#execute()` is called, passing in
an ArrayList of canteens and the Ui object instantiated in NusFoodReviews.

The program first checks if the ArrayList of canteens has more than 0 canteens.
If there are, the program will continue with the canteen deletion process. 
If there are no canteens yet, a short message is printed and the program returns from `DeleteCanteenCommand`.

The remaining canteen deletion process is as follows: 
`Ui#showDisplaySelectCanteens()` is first called to display canteens for the user to select.
The program waits for user input with`Ui#readCommand()`. If the input is 'cancel', 
`Ui#showCanteenNotDeleted()` is called and the program returns from `DeleteCanteenCommand`.
Otherwise, `Parser#parseInt()` is called to check if the user input is a valid index of the canteens array.
The canteen is then removed from the canteens ArrayList, 
and `Ui#showCanteenDeleted()` is called to display the canteen deleted message.

The static method `UpdateFile#deleteAndUpdateFile()` is also called to update the storage.

### [Admin] Add Store
![AddCanteen Sequence Diagram](./img/AddStore.png)

To add a store, `AddStoreCommand#execute()` is called, passing in
an ArrayList of canteens and the Ui object instantiated in NusFoodReviews.

When `AddStoreCommand` is instantiated, the reference to the main program nusFoodReviews is passed.
`NusFoodReviews#setCanteenIndex()` will first be called to prompt the user on which canteen they wish to look at.
The result for this is saved as a private int in `NusFoodReviews`, 
and can be accessed by calling `NusFoodReviews#getCanteenIndex()`.

`Ui#showDisplayStores` and `Ui#showAddCanteen()` is called to display the stores and the add store prompt.
The program will then wait for user input, looping continuously if a valid Store name is not entered.
Invalid names include: existing store names.
If the user inputs 'cancel', the loop is exited and the program returns from `AddStoreCommand`.

Once a valid StoreName is entered, `Canteen#addStore()` will be called to instantiate the Store object 
and append it to the ArrayList of Stores stored in the relevant Canteen object.
`Ui#printStoreAdded()` is then called to display store added confirmation.

The static method `WriteToFile#saveStore()` is also called to update the storage.

### [Admin] Delete Stores
![DeleteStores](./img/DeleteStores.png)

When DeleteStoreCommand was first instantiated, the relevant canteen index 
and store index was passed into the constructor. To delete a store, `DeleteStoreCommand.execute()` 
is called, passing in an ArrayList of canteens and the Ui object instantiated in 
NusFoodReviews.`DeleteStoreCommand.execute()`will then call `get(canteenIndex)` on the canteen object 
to get the current Canteen before calling deleteStore(storeIndex) to delete the store.

### [Admin] Delete Reviews
![DeleteReviews](img/DeleteReviews.png)

When DeleteReviewCommand was first instantiated, the relevant canteen index, review,
and store index was passed into the constructor. To delete a review, `DeleteReviewCommand.execute()`
is called, passing in an ArrayList of canteens and the Ui object instantiated in
NusFoodReviews.`DeleteReviewCommand.execute()`will then call `get(canteenIndex)` on the canteen object
to get the current Canteen before calling getStore(storeIndex) to get current Store. After that, deleteReview(review)
is called on the store object. Ui.reviewDeleted() displays a message to show that the review was deleted.
