## 1. Setting up

The instructions for setting up can be [found here](https://ay2021s2-cs2113t-t09-1.github.io/tp/SettingUp.html).

## 2. Design

### 2.1 Architecture
![Architecture](images/Architecture.png)

*Figure 1. Architecture Diagram*

The ***Architecture Diagram*** shown above explains the high-level design of Control Your Crowd (CYC) application.
Below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` is a class that is critical to starting the application proper, as well as exiting it:
* At app launch: Retrieves memory and saved log files (If available), initializes components in correct sequence,
  and connects them with each other.

* At shut down: It saves the log file to storage, and shuts down all components.


`Common` consists of a class of messages used by multiple components.
* `Messages` consists of a list of messages that will be displayed to the users, for various reasons such as error handling
  and user notification.

The rest of Control-Your-Crowd (CYC) consist of four components.
* `UI`: The user interface of the application, and the entry point from the user.

* `Logic`: The command executor for CYC.

* `Model` : Holds the in-App data, such as the details of the user, and their checked-in/checked-out status.

* `Storage`: Reads and writes data from the hard disk to CYC.

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `clear`.

![](images/ComponentsInteractionsDiagram.png?raw=true "Component interactions for clear command")

*Figure 2. Component interactions for `clear` command*

### 2.2 UI component

![](images/UIComponentStructure.png?raw=true "Logic component Sequence Diagram for clear")

*Figure 3. Structure of UI component*


**API** : [`seedu.duke.ui`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/ui) package

The UI consists of `TextUi` class. It acts as a middleware between users' input
and `Parser` class under **Logic Component**.

The `UI` component,

* Reads user commands using `Scanner` class.
* Pass raw user commands into `Parser` class under **Logic Component**.
* After the **Logic Component** has executed the function, it will then return `CommandOutput` object
  which contains the outcome of the execution, fail or succeed.

### 2.3 Logic component

![](images/LogicComponentStructure.png?raw=true "Structure of Logic Component")

*Figure 4. Structure of the Logic Component*

**API** : [`seedu.duke.logic`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/logic) package

The Logic component,
1. Uses the `Parser` class to parse the user input obtained by the `TextUi` class of `UI`.
2. This results in a specific `Command` object to be returned from the `Parser` class.
3. Depending on the type of the `Command` object, its corresponding command execution will be called by `Main` class.
4. Some command execution affects the data in `Model` (e.g. clearing the list).
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandOutput` object which is passed back to the `TextUi`.
6. In addition, the `CommandOutput` object can also instruct the `TextUi` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the list to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `parseCommand("clear)"` API call.

![](images/LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png?raw=true "Logic component Sequence Diagram for clear")

*Figure 5. Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `clear` Command*

### 2.4 Model component

<img src="images/ModelComponentStructure.png" width="600" height="600" alt="Model Component Structure" />

*Figure 6. Structure of the Model Component*

**API** : [`seedu.duke.model`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/model) package

The Model component,

* contains a `Person` class which represents a person who checks in/out.
* contains a `TrackingList` class which uses an ArrayList to keep track of all the `Person` objects who have currently checked in/out.
* contains a `PersonLog` class which uses a HashMap to permanently store all the `Person` objects who have checked in before.

A `Person` object contains:
* an `Id` object
* a `Name` object
* a `Phone` object


### 2.5 Storage component

![](images/storage_module.png?raw=true "Storage Module diagram")

*Figure 7. Structure of the Storage Component*

**API** : [`seedu.duke.storage`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/storage) package

The `Storage` component,
* saves and encodes `Person` objects in `Tracking List` into a `.txt` file.
* reads a `.txt` file of valid encoding and populates a `TrackingList`
* records a log of all historical states of `TrackingList`
* keeps a list of user setting in a `Config.properties` file which is read on launch
* defaults to `TrackingList.txt` but can be saved at a custom specified location
* loads on program startup automatically saves after each command

The storage module uses the `StorageFile` class to store the `TrackingList` class from Model.
`StorageFile` achieves this by using two helper classes, `TrackingListEncoder` and `TrackingListDecoder`.
`StorageFile` is called by the main class after the execution of any `Command`.

`TrackingListEncoder` takes the currently stored `TrackingList` and converts it to a more storage friendly String.
This String is then written to a file on the disk, known on the diagram as `StoredTrackingList`.
As the name suggests, `TrackingListDecoder` achieves the reverse by taking the file on drive, `StoredTrackingList`,
and interprets the file to be loaded into the memory as a `TrackingList`.

![](images/storage_pathdir.png?raw=true "Storage Module file structure")

*Figure 8. Illustration of Storage Structure*

`StoredTrackingList` is the `.txt` file stored in the same directory as the program.
The location is determined by the `ConfigFile` class.

`LogFile` takes the `TrackingList` every time the storage is updated
and packages it into `json` formatted string.
`LogFile` communicates with the disk by calling the methods
`loadLogFile` and `saveLogFile` in the `StorageFile` class.

`History` stores a record every time the `Command` `CheckIn` and `CheckOut` are successfully executed.
It includes information about the `Person` details, `Time` the person checked in, and movement
(whether the person was checked in or checked out)
The data is stored in a `csv` format in `History.txt`.

The program settings for the user is manged by the `ConfigFile` class.
Another file, `settingsFile` is read by `ConfigFile` when the program is started,
to load the settings into the program memory.
When a change is made by the user, `ConfigFile` will update the `settingsFile` through a save function.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.duke.commons`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/commons) package.

## 3. Implementation
This section describes some significant details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Visitor Log feature

The visitor log feature is implemented using two classes, `PersonLog` class and `LogFile` class. `PersonLog` provides
a runtime storage while `LogFile` provides a long term storage. Only the `PersonLog` class provides the API for
the Visitor Log feature. So, other classes should only access the `PersonLog`'s methods.

#### 3.1.1 PersonLog
`PersonLog` uses a Java HashMap to store the details of a `Person` object. It uses a visitor's identification number, 
`Id` object, as a key to the HashMap.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `addPerson(Person object)` - Adds a `Person` object into the HashMap.
* `findPerson(Id obect)` - Returns a `Person` object if found.
* `saveAllPersons()` - Saves all the visitor's information into the `LogFile`.
* `loadAllPersons()` - Load all the visitor's information from the `LogFile`.

#### 3.1.2 LogFile
`LogFile` uses Google's [`Gson`](https://github.com/google/gson) Java library to convert between a `Person` object and 
its JSON representation. It then uses a `StorageFile` object to write or load the JSON representation from the disk. 
All the visitor details are saved in `LogFile.txt`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations to be used by `PersonLog`:
* `saveAllPersons(ArrayList<Person> object)` - Converts all the `Person` objects given into JSON representation and 
  saves them into the disk, using a `StorageFile` object.
* `loadAllPersons()` -  Loads the JSON representation of the `Person` objects in the disk, using a `StorageFile` object.
  It then converts the JSON representation into `Person` objects.

The following sequence diagram shows how loading all the visitor's information from storage functionality works:

![VisitorLogSequenceDiagram.png](images/VisitorLogSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 9. Component interactions for `loadAllPersons()`*

#### 3.1.3 Design Considerations
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Save all the `Person` objects into the disk every time a new 
  `Person` is added into the HashMap.
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues as it is inefficient to rewrite the entire file every time a new `Person` object 
    is added.
* Alternative 2: Save only the new `Person` object added into the HashMap, 
  using append mode when writing into the file.
  - Pros: Efficient performance
  - Cons: Before writing a new `Peron` object into the file, need to check if the previous
    records in the file were not tampered with.

## 4. Documentation

Refer to the Documentation Guide [here](https://ay2021s2-cs2113t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DocumentationGuide.html).

## 5. Testing

### Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right click on a test package, test class, or a test, and
choose `Run 'ABC'`.


## 6. Dev Ops

### Build Automation

Crowd Your Control uses Gradle for **build automation and dependency management**.

Given below are how to use Gradle for some important project tasks.

* **`shadowJar`**: Uses the ShadowJar plugin to creat a fat JAR file in the `build/lib` folder, *if the current file is outdated*.<br>
  e.g. `./gradlew shadowJar`.

* **`run`**: Builds and runs the application.<br>
  **`runShadow`**: Builds the application as a fat JAR, and then runs it.

* **`checkstyleMain`**: Runs the code style check for the main code base.<br>
  **`checkstyleTest`**: Runs the code style check for the test code base.

* **`test`**: Runs all tests.<
    * `./gradlew test` — Runs all tests
    * `./gradlew clean test` — Cleans the project and runs tests


### Continous Integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI. The project comes with the necessary GitHub Actions configurations 
files (in the `.github/workflows` folder). No further setting up required.

* Repository-wide checks

### Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

1. Update the version number in [`Main.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/Main.java).
1. Generate a fat JAR file using Gradle (i.e., `gradlew shadow`).
1. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
1. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Upload the JAR file you created.

4. Check in a visitor after the maximum capacity is reached
    1. **Prerequisite:** Check if maximum capacity is reached. The number of people left to maximum capacity can be
    obtained using `listcheckedin` command, or the current capacity can be obtained whenever a visitor is successfully
    checked in or out. If needed, check in visitors until maximum capacity is reached.
    2. Check in a visitor who has not checked in yet.
    
        **Expected:** The visitor will not be checked in. An error message with maximum capacity reached will be shown.

        **Expected:** A message with the visitor corresponding to the given ID has already checked out will be shown.


3. Check out a visitor who is not registered
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that the visitor you are trying to check out is not in the `LogFile.txt` file
        by checking the ID.
    2. **Test case:** `checkout i/123C` (where a visitor with ID 123C is not found in the `LogFile.txt` file)
    
        **Expected:** An error message with no such person found will be shown.

#### Clearing all visitor
> Note: 
> * Clear refers to removing all the visitors in the `TrackingList`.
>   * The data in the `TrackingList.txt` file will also be cleared.
>   * The data in the `History.txt` and `LogFile.txt` files will be **not** be cleared.

1. Clearing all the visitors if any
    1. **Test case:** `clear`
        
        **Expected:** A message indicating the number of visitors cleared will be shown.
    
#### Editing maximum capacity
> Note:
> * Valid capacity value means that the capacity **must** be a positive number that is less than 7 digits.
> * Invalid capacity value means that the capacity is either a negative number, or a positive number that is more than 
> 6 digits.

1. Editing maximum capacity with a valid capacity value
    1. **Prerequisites:** The current capacity must be known first. The current capacity can be obtained whenever a
    visitor is successfully checked in or out. The current capacity can also be calculated by using the number of visitors
    left to reach maximum capacity with the `listcheckedin` command.
    2. **Test case:** `editmax X` (where X is more than or equal to the current capacity)
    
        **Expected:** A success message with the new maximum capacity of X will be shown.
    3. **Test case:** `editmax Y` (where Y is less than the current capacity)
    
        **Expected:** Maximum capacity is not updated. A message with the error details and the current capacity
        will be shown.


2. Editing maximum capacity with an invalid capacity value
    1. **Prerequisites:** Similar to the previous prerequisites.
    2. **Test case:** `editmax N` (where N is a negative number)
    
        **Expected:** Maximum capacity is not updated. Error details will be shown in the message.
    3. **Test case:** `editmax P` (where P is a positive number that is more than 6 digits)
    
        **Expected:** Similar to previous.

#### Finding a visitor
> Note:
> * A valid visitor means that the person can be found in the `TrackingList`.
> * An invalid visitor means that the person cannot be found in the `TrackingList`.
>   * It could be because the person got removed when the `TrackingList` was cleared or
>   the person is not registered in the `PersonLog`.

1. Finding a valid visitor
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that the person you are trying to find is in the `TrackingList`.
    2. **Test case:** `find i/123A` (where 123A is the ID of the valid visitor to be found)
        
        **Expected:** The details of the visitor found including the checked in status.
    

2. Finding an invalid visitor
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that the person you are trying to find is not in the `TrackingList` or in the `PersonLog`.
    2. **Test case:** `find i/123B` (where 123B is the ID of a visitor not in the `TrackingList`)
        
        **Expected:** A person not found message will be shown.
    3. **Test case:** `find i/123C` (where 123C is the ID of a visitor not in the `PersonLog`)
    
        **Expected:** Similar to previous.

        **Expected:** A table with the particulars of all the visitors currently checked in will be displayed.
        Number of people left to reach maximum capacity will also be provided.

#### Listing all visitors
> Note:
> * `listall` command shows a list of all the visitors currently in the `TrackingList`.
>   * It does not show you the list of all the visitors registered in the `PersonLog`.

1. Listing all the visitors
    1. **Test case:** `listall`
    
        **Expected:** A table with the particulars of all the visitors currently in the `TrackingList`
