## **Introduction** ##

iGraduate is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that helps NUS Information Security students track and plan their
graduation by allowing them to add, delete, update modules to the module list. The users are allowed to add Core, 
General Education (GE), Math and Elective modules for tracking. There is also a built-in CAP calculator and Progress 
Command to check their graduation progress. Users can also list down modules on the list. When listing the modules, the
module type will be shown accordingly.

## **Setting Up, Getting Started** ##

This section guides you through the process of setting up the project on your computer.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** This application is developed for users with `Java 11` installed on their computer. 
> If you do not have it installed on your computer or if you have other versions of Java, follow this 
> [link](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) to download and install it before continuing 
> with this section. 

> üìù **Tip:** To check if you have `Java 11` installed, type `java --version` into a command prompt

Fork the [iGraduate repository](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-W09-2/tp) to your GitHub account and clone it to your local computer. 
Alternatively, you could also download the source code of the application 
directly from our [latest release](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-W09-2/tp/releases).

### **Terminal** ###

1. Open a new terminal in the folder/directory where the `build.gradle` resides, and run `gradlew.bat run` on 
   Windows platform or run `./gradlew run` on macOS/Linux platform.
   <br>
1. You will see the following output in the console when the setup is successful:

```
Starting without existing module data...
Initializing new module list...

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **IntelliJ IDEA** ###

1. Configure IntelliJ IDEA to use `JDK 11` by referring to the [IDEA set up guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk). 
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** This developer guide uses IntelliJ IDEA as the default IDE. It is recommended to install IntelliJ to follow the guide. 
1. Import the project as a `Gradle` project
    > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning!** Importing a `Gradle` project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.

    > üìù **Tip:** IntelliJ IDEA has the `Gradle` plugin installed by default. If you have 
    disabled it, go to `File` ‚Üí `Settings` ‚Üí `Plugins` to re-enable them.
    > If there is a `build.gradle` file in the project root, IntelliJ treats it as a `Gradle` project by default.
    > 1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` ‚Üí `Close Project` 
    to close the existing project first)
    > 1. Open the project into IntelliJ
    >    - Click `Open`.
    >    - Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
    >    - If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
    > 1. Click `OK` to accept the default settings but do ensure that the selected version 
        of Gradle JVM matches the JDK being used for the project.
    > 1. Wait for the importing process to finish (could take a few minutes).
1. Verify the setup by running `seedu.igraduate.IGraduate`. If successful, the console would output the following: 
    ```
    Starting without existing module data...
    Initializing new module list...

## **Design** ##
The following section is an overview of the design architecture. Each Sub-section provides a more detailed 
explanation for the design of each individual components.  

### **Architecture Diagram** ###
![archi](./images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.1.1** Architecture diagram showing an overview of the main components in iGraduate*</sup>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Architecture** ###
iGraduate has one class called `iGraduate` which contains a `main` and `run` method and `iGraduate` constructor. 
It is responsible for:

- **At app launch**: Initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- **At shut down**: Shuts down the components and invokes clean up methods where necessary.

`Commons` represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:
1. `UI` -> The UI of the App.
1. `Logic` -> The command executor.
    - `Parser` -> Understands and interprets the commands input by user, passes command to run to Command.
    - `Command` -> Executes command based on what is parsed.
1. `Model` -> The user data held by the program
    - `Module` -> Holds the information of individual modules.
    - `ModuleList` -> Holds data of all modules of the app in memory.
1. `Storage` -> Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,
- Defines its API in an interface with the **same name** as the Component.
- Exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API interface mentioned in the previous point.)

Given below is the sequence diagram of the startup sequence of iGraduate before any user input.

![archi](./images/StartupSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.1.2** Sequence diagram of iGraduate from startup until before first user input.*</sup>

The startup sequence sets up all objects required for running commands, such as the `Ui` and fetching of stored data from `Storage`.
Given below is the sequence diagram of how the architecture handles the flow of execution of commands and how the program exits.

![archi](./images/ExecutionSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.1.3** Sequence diagram of iGraduate from receiving the first user input until exit.*</sup>

<!--@@author oscarlai1998-->

### **UI Component** ###

The UI is a public class that consists of **three components**: `Scanner`, `Constants` and `Print Methods`. The UI component mainly manages the retrieval of user command and display of user feedback, ranging from successful execution, execution results and exceptions. 

***Behaviour***<br>

- Listens for calls from the [logic component](#logic-component) and [model component](#model-component), which will call the specific print method to print an output.
- Print method references `Constants` and prints them for user to see.

![archi](./images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.2** UML class diagram for Ui class*</sup>

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!--@@author fupernova-->

### **Logic Component** ###

The logic component consists of  the class `Parser` and the package `Command`. The classes work together to interpret user input, identify the right command to execute and the execution of the input command. 

***Behaviour***<br>
- `Parser` identifies the command to run and extracts the parameters and flags
required for the command from user input
- `Parser` passes these values to `command`, creating an instance of the object from the type of command detected. 
- `Command` then runs the command with the processed parameters and flags.

----

### **Parser Class** ###
The `Parser` class is part of the [logic](#logic-component) component. 

The `Parser` interprets user input and subsequently passes the properly processed user input to `Command` to execute the command.

Given below is the `Parser` class diagram showing the important methods that returns a `Command` object. As shown, `Parser` contains one class, `Parser.java` and the main function is the `parseCommand()` method.

![archi](./images/ParserClassDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.3** UML class diagram for Parser class*</sup>

***Behaviour***<br>

 - `parseCommand()`extracts the command phrase entered by the user by extracting the first word of the user input.
 - Based on the type of command from the user, `parseCommand()` then calls different methods to extract parameters and flags from the user command that are relevant to the command. 
 - The parser then creates the relevant `Command` object and dispatches the control of the program to the created object. 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** 
> - Interpretation and checking of parameter validity occurs in the parser. 
> - The Parser also contains checks that ensures the parameters passed are appropriate. 

The methods that extract the various parameters and flags, which would be invoked based on the command word detected in the user input:

|Method|Description|Invoked with|
|------|-----------|------------|
|`extractModuleCode()`|Extracts the **module code** by checking for the `-c` flag. |`createAddCommand()`|
|`extractModuleType()`|Extracts the **module type** by checking for the `-t` flag. |`createAddCommand()`|
|`extractModuleCredits()`|Extracts the **module credits** by checking for the `-mc` flag. |`createAddCommand()`, `createUpdateCommand()`|
|`extractModuleGrade()`|Extracts the **module grade** obtained by checking for the `-g` flag. |`createDoneCommand()`, `createUpdateCommand()`|
|`extractModuleName()`|Extracts the **module name** by checking for the `-n` flag. |`createUpdateCommand()`|
|`extractPreRequisites()`|Extracts the **module prerequisites** by checking for the `-p` flag. |`createAddCommand()`, `createUpdateCommand()`|
|`extractListScope()`|Extracts the **list type**. Accepts all, complete,  incomplete or available as acceptable scopes. |`createListCommand()`|

<sup>***Table 1.4** Methods invoked to extract various flags in various commands*</sup>

<br>

The method that check various parameters:

|Method|Description|
|------|-----------|
|`isModuleCodeValid()`|Checks that the module code is a valid module code according to the standard for NUS modules. The method uses **regex** to check for the valid code. There are 2 overloading methods - one for checking a single instance and another for an array list to check through a list of module codes.|

<sup>***Table 1.5** Method invoked to check the validity of the `module code` inputted*</sup>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<!--@@author LJ-37-->

### **Command Package** ###
The `command` component executes the correct command based on what the parser interprets.

The `command` component consists of an abstract class `Command` and 10 subclasses that inherit from it. The subclasses are:
1. AddCommand
1. CapCommand
1. DeleteCommand
1. DoneCommand
1. ExitCommand
1. HelpCommand
1. InfoCommand
1. ListCommand
1. ProgressCommand
1. UpdateCommand

***Behaviour***<br>
The correct command is executed once the `Command` object is created by the parser by executing the `execute()` method in the correct subclass.
The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
At the end of each command execution, different methods in the `Ui` will be called to perform certain actions, such as displaying the list of modules to the user.

Below are the Command class diagrams, split into 3 diagrams for better readability.

### **Model Component** ###

The `model` component consists of two main packages, `module` and `list`, which define and deal with data storing issues based on the information provided by the user input. 

***Behaviour***<br>
The data storing issues are split into two main categories - what data should be included in a module and a container managing the module objects. 
- `module` holds the information which acts as a blueprint for creating and manipulating module objects 
- `list` consists of a class that defines the way the module objects 
should be managed and stored.

----

#### **Module Package** ####

The `module` package consists of classes that are used to define the type of data to be stored in a module object and establish a framework to show how other components can make use of the features in module classes.

***Behaviour***<br>
The `module` package consists of classes related to module objects. 
- An abstract class `Module` is created to hold attributes and methods applicable to all class objects.
- `Module` is then inherited by all other child module classes. 

A class diagram illustrating the relationship between the interaction of classes under the module package is shown below.

![archi](images/ModuleClassDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.7** UML class diagram for the Module package*</sup>

The following child classes handle different types of modules based on the generic module type available in the university:
- `CoreModule`
- `GeModule`
- `ElectiveModule`
- `MathModule`

Each of the module classes consists of:
- Attributes related to the module type it is representing
- Getter and setter methods for setting and retrieval of its attributes
- Methods that alter an instance of its own class

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Module Class** ####

`Module` class is an abstract class in the module package. It holds the attributes and methods for manipulating the 
attributes applicable to all modules. The attributes found in the `Module` class are relevant to NUS module information.

***Behaviour***<br>

The `Module` class also consists of methods that set and get the value of attributes shown in the table above. There are 
four additional methods in the class, namely `removeUntakenPreRequisite`, `removeRequiredByModule`, `getStatusIcon`and `toString`
. The `removeUntakenPreRequisite` and `removeRequiredByModule` methods are used to remove a single`untakenPreRequisites` module 
and `requiredByModules` module respectively, whereas `getStatusIcon` returns the status icon based on the module 
status. For customized formatting of module printing messages, `toString` method is overridden.

|Child Class|Behaviour|
|-----------|---------|
|`CoreModule`|Initializes the core module object with the information needed and contains a `toString` method that overrides the format of core module printing.|
|`GeModule`|Initializes the general education module object with the information needed and contains a `toString` method that overrides the format of general education module printing.|
|`ElectiveModule`|Initializes the elective module object with the information needed and contains a `toString` method that overrides the format of elective module printing.|
|`MathModule`|Initializes the math module object with the information needed and contains a `toString` method that overrides the format of math module printing.|

<sup>***Table 1.8** Child classes that inherited from the `Module` class*</sup>

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!--@@author fupernova-->

### **List Package** ###
The `list` package contains an `ArrayList` of type `Module`, representing
the entire list of `Module` objects added by the user. It also defines the methods used to modify the data of existing `Module` objects,
such as adding, deleting or marking a `Module` as done.

***Behaviour***<br>
The package consists of 1 class, `ModuleList.java`. `ModuleList` contains 2 constructor signatures; 1 for constructing a
new, empty list for when the user uses iGraduate for the first time, and the other to contain the modules already stored
in `Storage`.

----

#### **ModuleList Class** ####

The `ModuleList` class acts as an abstraction for the ArrayList that is used to store module objects created from any of the classes under the `module` package.

Given below is the class diagram of `ModuleList` showing its 3 main functions.

![archi](./images/ModuleListClassDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.9** UML class diagram for ModuleList class*</sup>

***Behaviour***<br>
The `ModuleList` class:
- Provides a `ModuleList` structure with features built on top of ArrayList to enhance and customize its usage for the application. 
- Added data-related methods `addModuleRequiredBy` and `removeTakenPreRequisiteModule` to aid data processing when adding a module to the `ModuleList`. 
- The `ModuleList` class is also used by the `Storage` component to generate JSON data of all modules and store it to disk.
- Within the class `ModuleList`, different methods are defined to perform different operations on the list of `Modules`. These operations are:
    1. [Add](#add-a-module) a module to the list
    1. [Delete](#delete-a-module) a module from the list
    1. [Mark](#mark-module-as-taken) a module as done
- Apart from these 3 operations, the `ModuleList` class also defines getter and setter methods to retrieve  individual modules from the list according to different parameters such as module code or index. 

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Add a Module** ####

The methods `add`, `addModuleRequiredBy` and `removeTakenByPrerequisites` are invoked to add a module. 

The following shows the process of adding a module named `newModule`:
1. `addModuleRequiredBy`is called to populate the list of modules that require `newModule` as a prerequisite. 
1. `removeTakenByPrerequisites` checks the list of prerequisites of `newModule` and removes the ones that have been marked as taken.
1. `add` calls `ArrayList.add()` to add `newModule` to the list.

----

#### **Delete a Module** ####

The methods `delete` and `removeFromPreRequisiteModuleRequiredBy` are invoked to delete a module. 

The following shows the process of deleting a module named `existingModule`:
1. `delete` calls `ArrayList.remove()` to delete `existingModule` from the list.
1. `removeFromPreRequisiteModuleRequiredBy` is called to remove `existingModule` from its pre-requisite modules' requiredBy list.

----

#### **Mark Module as Taken** ####

The methods `markAsTaken` and `removeFromModuleUntakenPrerequisites` are invoked to mark a module as taken. 

The following shows the process of marking a module named `existingModule` as done:
1. `markAsTaken` calls `Module.setStatus` and sets the status of `existingModule` to "taken".
1. `removeFromModuleUntakenPrerequisites` is called to remove `existingModule` from the prerequisitesUntaken table from the list of modules that require `existingModule` as a prerequisite.

### **Storage Component** ###
The storage component consists of the class `Storage`. The storage component is closely associated with the [`ModuleList`](#modulelist) component to store latest module information (including completion, code, name, prerequisites, etc.) in a JSON format after every manipulation of `ModuleList`. This includes adding, deleting and updating of modules, as well as marking a module as done.

### **Common Classes** ###
The common class used by multiple components in this app are in the `exception` package. The `exceptions` are thrown when an error occurs. The method catches the exceptions and prints out the respective error message. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Each `exception` is specified by the name and description.

***Behaviour***

## **Implementation** ##
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain feature are implemented. 

### **UI** ###

The Ui feature has 3 primary responsibilities: 
1. Executes user command using [`Logic Component`](#logic-component)
1. Prints resulting message
1. Listens to calls from Model data

<!--@@author xseh-->

### **Parser** ###

The parser feature has 4 primary responsibilities: 
1. Identify the command the user wants to run
1. Extract the relevant parameters and flags required to run the command
1. Check the validity of the parameters and flags   
1. Create a new `Command` object and hand it over to `iGraduate` to execute

<br>

![archi](./images/ParserSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.12** Sequence diagram of `Parser` in execution with `done CS1010 -g A` as user input*</sup>

***Details***<br>
There are 3 classifications of user input: **command, parameter and flags**. 

|User input|Description|Usage/Example|
|----------|-----------|---------|
|`command`|the type of command the user intends to run and is first word from the user input|dictates how `Parser` extracts the parameter and flags. Refer to [Command](#command) for the list of available commands|
|`parameter`|the argument that comes after the command word and can vary depending on the command|specifies the identifier (module name or code or list type) for the modules. For example, the parameter for `add`command would be the module name, but the parameter for `delete` would be the module code. For list, the parameters would specify the type of list (complete, incomplete or available)|
|`flag`|comes after parameters and are available only for a few commands|specify the additional information required for the command to run. For `add`, flags would be for module code, module type, MCs and prerequisites.|

<sup>**Table 1.13** Terms used in differentiating the different parts of a user command </sup>

***Considerations*** : How to implement parsing of user input<br>

From the start, it was known that `Parser` would be one of the more challenging components to implement due to the 
large number of commands and the variance in parameter and flag types. Another difficult problem to navigate around was the
validation of the format and values of the parameters and flags. Initially, no validation checks were implemented in `Parser`,
with the respective `Command` subclasses doing the input validation for their specific parameters and flags. However, 
the `Storage` component also requires the same checks as the `Command` component. As such, there was a dependency 
between `Storage` and `Command`, which does not make sense as the responsibilities of the two are completely unlinked.
Hence, the validation of parameters and flags were moved to `Parser`. In this implementation of `Parser`, the `Storage` 
and `Command` components are unaware of each other, instead relying on `Parser` for extracting and validating inputs. 
This helps to eliminate the dependency between `Storage` and `Command`.

***Alternatives***<br>
1. Custom (current choice): Designing and implementing a custom parser for iGraduate
    - Pros: 
        - Better suited for target users (fast typists)
    - Cons: 
        - Less sophisticated error and exception handling
        - Higher risk of bugs
        - More complicated to implement

1. Outsource: Adopt third-party libraries to perform parsing
    - Pros: 
        - More resilient to error and exceptions
        - Less design considerations
    - Cons: 
        - Less suitable for iGraduate behaviour

Considerations were made for the adoption of third-party parser libraries. However, the third-party libraries obtained did not achieve the behaviour that was envisioned. Instead of keeping the application running when executing any commands, the command, parameters and flags would have to be directly piped in the command terminal, together with the application. This would create an instance of the iGraduate application before terminating after one command. Though this may provide a far superior parsing and error and exception handling, the behaviour does not support the target audience. Therefore, the decision was made against using a third-party library. Instead, attempts were made to mimic the behaviours and error handling of the libraries, but within the context of the running application. 

***Considerations*** : Format to store module information<br>

An `arrayList` is used to store the parsed data from the user input instead of an `array`. This is to make use of the built-in class functions (especially `indexOf()` and `size()`). The `array` class also lacks certain features that are of good use to the `parser` class. This includes the use of regex for checking against the values stored in each index without making the process too manual. For instance, `matches()` of `arrayList` automatically takes in a regex instead of having to manually create a regex object, then parsing into the `find()` function, which loops through the entire array to obtain the matches. This significantly simplifies the code in the `parser` function, and makes handling exceptions easier. 

***Alternatives***<br>
1. ArrayList (current choice)
    - Pros:
        - Equipped with useful built-in class functions
        - Significantly simplifies logic needed to parse flags and parameters
    - Cons: 
        - Less Memory efficient
1. Array
    - Pros: 
        - Efficient memory allocation
        - Fixed size, which uses less memory
    - Cons: 
        - Inefficient in extracting input flags
        - Limited functionalities

Initially, it was decided that the parameters would be split into an `array` to utilise the efficient memory allocation and standard size because  arrays are more memory efficient. The parsing does not modify any values in the array after the initial split to the arrays (i.e. no additions of removal of data needed). However, the process needed to extract the flags from the array is inefficient, and requires another method to locate. Furthermore, the array in limited in its capabilities, making the coding of some behaviour complicated (such as filtering with a regex value). Therefore, the array ultimately got changed into an `arrayList` type, since `arrayList` has more features that can be utilised to make the code more efficient.

### **Command** ###

The `command` package is responsible for executing the command from the user. The package contains the abstract class 
`Command` and 10 subclasses that inherit `Command`, one for each valid iGraduate command .

***Details***<br>
The abstract class `Command` contains only 1 method: `execute()`, which takes in 3 parameters: `moduleList`, `ui` and
`storage`. These 3 parameters aid with printing information to the user, making modifications to the data and saving the
data. Each subclass of `Command` overrides `execute()` and implements their own methods to execute the command. Each 
subclass also has a unique constructor signature as each subclass requires different parameters to execute.

***Implementation***<br>
The implementation for executing every command differs, and the implementation details of each of them will be further 
elaborated below.

----

<!--@@author kewenlok-->

#### **Add Command** ####

The add command allows a user to add a new module to the list of existing modules. The module name is part of the 
parameters and is extracted directly from user input while the various information required to add a new module are 
included in the flags of the user input. 

There are 3 compulsory flags and 1 optional flag for adding a module:

1. module code
    - `-c <String>`
1. module credits
    - `-mc <double>`
1. module type
    - `-t <String>`
1. (Optional) prerequisite modules
    - `-p [<String>, ...]`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** The order of flags in user input does not matter.

The sequence diagram below shows the execution of add command in action:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Delete Command** ####

The delete command allows for deletion of module from the module list, identified by the module code, which is extracted
from user input as a parameter. There are no flags involved for deleting a module.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Users cannot delete modules which are prerequisites for other modules.

#### **Update Command** ####

The update commands allows users to modify existing modules, identified by the module code. 
The information that can be updated include module name, credits, prerequisites and grades (if the module is 
marked as done). 

The module code is extracted from user input as a parameter while the various information requested to update would be 
identified with their flags:
- name -> `-n <String>`
- module credits -> `-mc <int>`
- prerequisites -> `-p [<String>, ...]`
- grade -> `-g <String>`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** 
> - The code and type of modules **cannot be modified** as they are identifiers of the modules.
> - **Multiple module information** can be updated in a single command.
> - The command **will not update grades** if the module requested has not been completed. The rest of the information parsed in the command (if any) will be updated.

![archi](./images/UpdateCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.17** Sequence diagram of `UpdateCommand` in execution with `update CS1010 -mc 2` as user input*</sup>

***Considerations*** : Command behaviour<br>

The main considerations regarding the behaviour of the update command would be if multiple flags should be permitted in a single update command. 

***Alternatives***<br>

1. Restrict to single update flag
    - Pros: 
        - Simple to implement
        - Easier error and exception handling
    - Cons: 
        - Inconvenient and unsuitable for target audience
1. Allow multiple flags (current choice)
    - Pros: 
        - Suitable for target audience who are fast typists
        - Update Command makes it more convenient for users to change module information as compared to deleting a module and adding it again.
    - Cons: 
        - Complicated process when extracting flags
        - More considerations needed for error and exception handling

Having a single input would significantly simplify the code, as a simple switch statement will suffice. There is also less error and exception handling as only two parameters are given. In the event of an exception, simply retrace the command and throw exception. However, having only one flag at a time is inconvenient for fast typists, and is less optimized for their quick typing. 

Another alternative was to allow multiple flags, each with their own input and error handling. Extraction would be significantly more complex, as each flag has to be accounted for, extracted together with its trailing new value. Should one of the flag cause an exception, another consideration would be to determine if the command should be completely aborted or just the failed flag. The greatest advantage of parsing multiple updating instances would be to allow fast typists to quickly make multiple changes in a single command line. This caters much more to the target audience, and makes using iGraduate more convenient. Ultimately, decision was made to allow multiple flags, individually parsed with their own checks and extraction methods, reused from the other commands. 

***Considerations*** : Command error and exception handling management<br>

On the event of a failed flag, considerations have to made to determine how the update command would manage the rest of the flags. 

***Alternatives***<br>

1. Abort entire command
    - Pros:
        - Simple to implement
    - Cons:
        - Major inconvenience to users
1. Ignore failed flag
    - Pros:
        - More usable and convenient for users
    - Cons:
        - Extremely complex in error and exception handling
1. Ignore failed grade flag (current choice)
    - Pros:
        - Compromise between convenience and code difficulty
        - If grade flag generates an error, the other flags would still be updated
    - Cons:
        - Failure in other flags still results in aborting the entire command

The first way is to completely abort the entire command, which lowers the usability aspect of the application, creating inconvenience when a small error is encountered. However, this makes coding straightforward and simple. 

Another alternative is to simply ignore the failed flag and attempt to change the rest. This would make the update command more usable and convenient. However, the primary issue is the difficulty in designing and programming such behaviour, individual try and catch statements needs to be used. Each statement must be able to differentiate between having an invalid flag input or having a flag that does not exist (i.e. the user did not use the flag).  This behaviour makes the application significantly more complex to code and catch. 

Finally, decisions were made to compromise between the two alternatives. After some discussions, it was determined that grade (the -g flag) is the most likely to fail since it depends on not just the user input but if the module has been completed. Therefore, a dedicated try statement is used to ensure that, even in the event of errors associated with providing a grade to an incomplete module, the rest of the command would still be updated (the rest of the extracts and checking is in the final clause). Unfortunately, if the other flags fail, the program will abort entirely. This alternative balances the complexity between error and exception handling and usability, allowing some flexibility in managing error while providing some convenience.

#### **Info Command** ####

The info command provides a feature for the user to view any module they added to the list regardless of
the module type and status by specifying its module code. The module code is extracted from user input as a parameter. 
The command will only be executed if valid module code is provided by the user. All information of the specified module 
will be shown to the user to aid the planning of module. 

There are no flags required for this command.

An example of info command execution flow is shown in the sequence diagram below.

![archi](./images/InfoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.18** Sequence diagram of `InfoCommand` in execution with `info CS1010` as user input*</sup>

***Considerations***

After receiving feedback from a user stating that there are no ways for the user to view the prerequisite 
information for any modules, the team considered implementing a prerequisite column for the `list command` as
suggested by the user. However, after much consideration and discussion, the team felt that it could become too
convoluted and cluttered for the `list command` results as there are simply too much information to show in one
screen. Instead, the team decided to create a new `info command` to list the information of the module based on the module
code as specified by the user.

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!--@@author oscarlai1998-->

#### **List Command** ####

The list command provides users with 8 options to list down the modules being tracked by iGraduate. The options come in the
form of a parameter that is extracted from user input.

The table below is an overview of the list commands. 

|List Parameter|Scope|
|--------------|-----|
|`all`|List all modules being tracked|
|`complete`|List modules that have been marked as done|
|`incomplete`|List modules that have not been marked as done|
|`available`|List incomplete modules available to be marked as done based on prerequisites completed|
|`core`|List all core modules on the list|
|`math`|List all math modules on the list|
|`elec`|List all elective modules on the list|
|`ge`|List all GE modules on the list|

<sup>***Table 1.19.1*** Overview of the List function</sup>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!--@@author fupernova-->

#### **CAP Command** ####

The CAP command calculates the current CAP of the user based on the grades of modules that are marked as done. The 
command also displays the degree classification of the user. There are no flags or additional parameters required.

![archi](./images/CapCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.20** Sequence diagram of `CapCommand` class.*</sup>

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Done Command** ####

The done command is used to mark a module as completed. To execute this command, the module code is extracted as a 
parameter from user input, and there is 1 compulsory flag:
1. Grade obtained for module
    - `-g <String>`
   
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Only the following letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D+, D, F, S, U, CS, CU) are valid.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** Module codes are **case-insensitive**. This means that module codes like `CS2102` and `cs2102` are considered the same.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Progress Command** ####

The progress command prints a progress bar as well as the user's graduation progress in the form of a percentage. No 
additional flags are required for this command.

![archi](./images/ProgressSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.22** Sequence diagram of `ProgressCommand` in execution.*</sup>

----

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Help Command** ####

The help command provides users with a quick reference guide to the list of available commands, their functions and the 
proper format for inputs. Users also have an optional parameter to find the reference guide for a specific command.

The optional parameters are:
- `add`
- `delete`
- `update`
- `list`
- `info`
- `done`
- `progress`
- `cap`
- `exit`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** If no parameters are provided, a brief description of the program and the available commands will be printed instead.


The figure below demonstrates the behaviour of the help command. 

![archi](./images/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.23** Sequence diagram of `HelpCommand` in execution with `help add` as user input.*</sup>

***Considerations***

A quick reference guide where users can see the summary of commands and the different formats for each command.
One implementation considered was the format used for Linux `man` pages, where a single command line input displays all 
information about the functionality of the command and the types of parameters accepted. This was
the most straightforward implementation due to the ease of parsing possible user inputs and there being only one kind of
message to be displayed. This proved to be unfeasible from a User Experience point of view as there was too much information
displayed at one go due to the number of commands the application has and their unique formats. Instead, the team opted to
go for a more segmented implementation of the `help` command, with one command showing users how to use the reference guide
while the other commands provide a readable reference guide to the user that targets the command that users want to know 
more about.

### **Module** ###

The `module` component contains the class `module`, together with 4 child classes that inherit from `module`. All modules 
stored in iGraduate are instances of one of the 4 subclasses.

***Details***

For the implementation of modules in iGraduate, most of the information used to identify a module are contained in the
parent class `module`. The class contains the setters and getters of all the data pertaining a module, such as the module code,
grade and MCs. It also contains the lists that track the prerequisites of the module.

The implementation details of the subclasses are hence quite sparse, containing only a constructor and a public method `toString()` which identifies the type of module stored
in the `module` object.

***Considerations*** 

To accommodate the wide range of operations available to the modules, the implementation of the `module` component had to
be comprehensive in the data it stores. However, since every module shares the same categories of data to store, such as
module code and grade, the subclasses do not contain much information that is not already stored in their parent class. To
better accommodate our *list by module type* feature, the subclass each module belongs to is determined by the module type.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!--@@author kewenlok-->

### **ModuleList** ###

The `moduleList` component acts as a temporary storage for storing module data while application is 
running. All module data added to the application could be found under the `moduleList` storage.

***Details***

Since the `moduleList` is used for storing module data needed for running application, the module data 
will be loaded from the disk when the application first started. After any data changing command is executed,
the latest module data in the `moduleList` will be written to disk for permanent storage (unless the secondary
memory is faulty). It also consists of utility methods which allows retrieval, manipulation and deletion of 
module data in a centralised and consistent manner.

***Considerations***

At the start of project, an array is considered to be used as the underlying data structure for the `moduleList`
component. However, after taking the scalability issue into consideration, the team decided to incorporate an
`ArrayList` instead. Reason being `ArrayList` is a dynamically sized array along with standard methods such as 
whether the list contains a specific module, search and removal of specified module. The size of the `ArrayList`
is only limited by the user device's available memory size.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<!--@@author xseh-->

### **Storage** ###

The storage feature saves the state of the module list after every execution of commands that manipulates 
(i.e. update, add or delete) the modules in the list.

***Details***

The storage function is executed after every command that manipulates (i.e. adds, deletes or updates) the modules in the module list, saving the updated state into the storage file. 

The module list is stored in a storage file named `modules.json` in the `data` folder (`<program location>/data/modules.json`). 

The figure below demonstrates the behaviour of the storage feature. 

![archi](./images/StorageSequenceDiagram.png)

<sup>***Figure 1.23** UML sequence diagram showing the life of Storage when the `Add` command is invoked*</sup>

***Considerations***

The main reason in using a JSON file instead of designing one is to allow a more robust error and exception 
handling and management with respect to modified storage files. The parsing of JSON format is also more 
sophisticated and reliable. 

In addition, the JSON format can be read across multiple different types of applications, allowing flexibility
 in any future implementations regarding exporting of data. 

***Alternatives***

The alternative storage format considered is the use of delimiters. However, there are concerns regarding such usage; the most important being potential parsing failure from a valid module. With the use of common delimiters such as commas `,` and dashes `-`, the program is unable to differentiate between the various module information and legitimate module names containing delimiters and may parse the portion of the module to a wrong variable, resulting in a corrupted program. One example of such occurrence would be a module named `Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming`, which contains dashes when the delimiters are used for separating various module information is also a dash. 

Considerations were also given to use more unique delimiters (such as `\`, `|`, etc.) to avoid accidental parsing failures, but the problem still remained. Attempting to fuzz characters would lead to a corrupted storage file and render the application useless. Ultimately, the idea was scrapped in favour of the JSON format with a third-party library, since the exception handling and parsing management lies in the library functions.

### **Exception** ###

Exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the diagram. It is an object that is thrown at runtime.
In iGraduate, there are several exceptions that are thrown due to different conditions.

Exception   | Description              
--------|-------------------|
AddSelfToPrereqException |This exception is thrown when user updates a module's list of prerequisites to include the module itself.
DataFileNotFoundException | The exception is thrown if module data file is not found.
ExistingModuleException | The exception is thrown if the module code input already exists.             | 
IllegalParametersException | The exception is thrown if the parameter includes any parameters not allowed in the command.
IncorrectParameterCountException | The exception is thrown if the parameters given is incorrect.
InputNotNumberException | The exception is thrown if input is not an integer.
InvalidCommandException | The exception is thrown if the command input was invalid.
InvalidListTypeException | Exception is thrown if list command is not followed by: all, incomplete and complete.
InvalidModularCreditException | Exception is thrown if modular credit input is negative.
InvalidModuleGradeException | The exception is thrown if module grade input is invalid.
InvalidModuleTypeException | The exception is thrown if the module type input is invalid.
LoadModuleFailException | The exception is thrown if module cannot be loaded properly.
MarkCompletedModuleException | The exception is thrown if module is already marked completed.
ModifiedStoragefileException |  The exception is thrown if the json file has been modified (when credits > 32 or credits < 0).
ModuleNotCompleteException | The exception is thrown if the module being updated (on grade) has not been completed.
ModuleNotFoundException | The exception is thrown if the module cannot be matched.
PrerequisiteNotFoundException | The exception is thrown if the pre-requisite module cannot be matched.
PrerequisiteNotMetException | Exception is thrown if prerequisite of the module has not been completed.
SaveModuleFailException | This exception is thrown if the program fails to save data to file.
UnableToDeletePrereqModuleException | This exception is thrown when user tries to delete a pre-requisite module.

## **Logging** ##

The logging feature is implemented using the `java.util.logging` package. It is a default logging package included
in the Java package. To learn more about the package, you may refer to [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/package-summary.html).
To make use of logging feature, you will need to include the following line at the start of all the classes where logging
feature is to be used.

```
private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ClassName.class.getName());
```

When including the line above, remember to replace `ClassName` with the name of current class such as `iGraduate`. Once
you have done instantiating the logger object with the code above, you can use the logger object to start logging. For
more information on how logging works, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html).
The logging configurations are specified in the `logger.properties` file located in `src/main/resources/logger.properties`.
To change the logging configurations, simply modify the `logger.properties` file with the respective value. The current
configuration logs all messages with level of `FINE` and above into a log file, `iGraduate-0.log`, under the same folder
where the application resides.

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Documentation** ##

All the documentations related to the application are stored under the `/docs` folder. There are currently three
documentations, `AboutUs.md`, `UserGuide.md` and `DeveloperGuide.md`. The documentation tools used for developing these
guides are:

- [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax for formatting
- [PlantUML](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) for drawing diagrams
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for documentation static site generation
  For more information on how to set up a documentation site using Jekyll, you may refer to
