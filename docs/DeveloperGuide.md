## Introduction

Patient Manager is a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) application for _general practitioners_ (GP)
who work in clinics to manage their patient list. This includes a recording/retrieval of
past record of visit, scheduling of the next appointment, and some other features listed below.
With the Patient Manager, GPs will be able to reduce paperwork and have a more efficient way
to organize the records of their patients.

## Setting up the project in your computer

First, fork this repo, and clone the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):
1. Configure the JDK: Follow the guide 
   [Intellij IDEA: Configuring the JDK @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) \
   IDEA: Configuring the JDK to ensure Intellij is configured 
   to use JDK 11.
2. Import the project as a Gradle project: Follow the guide 
   [Intellij IDEA: Importing a Gradle project @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) \
   IDEA: Importing a Gradle project to import 
   the project into IDEA.
   > ❗ Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
3. Verify the setup: Run the `seedu.duke` and try a few commands. 
   Run the tests to ensure they all pass.

## Design & implementation

### Help command

When invoked by the user via the `help` command, information about the available commands is printed.
If arguments are provided, the arguments are parsed into the separate commands, and the information about each
command present in the arguments is printed in order. If the user provides an invalid command, an invalid command
message is shown, and the messages for the following commands are printed.

#### Alternatives considered

The original version of this command simply printed out the information messages of all commands. 
However, with a growing list of commands, we were worried that the help message would be too long and would
require scrolling.

The current version reads the arguments that are provided by the user, and prints out information messages for each
of the commands indicated. Unknown/invalid commands will not be skipped with a message indicating that the command is 
invalid, and the subsequent commands will continue to be processed. 

A future consideration would be to convert the message printed out when no arguments are provided to only print a list
of available commands for easier reference:
```
> help
-----------------------------------------------------------------
List of available commands:
...
...
Enter help <command> for more details of each command
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Product scope

### Target user profile

{Describe the target user profile}

### Value proposition

Through Patient Manager, general practitioners are able to manage patients faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed. 
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 patients without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should 
   be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

## Testing

### Automated Testing
We have both JUnit Test and IO Redirection Test. To run these tests, execute these commands in a shell or CMD:
```
### For JUnit tests
# *nix OS and MacOSX bash
./gradlew check
# Windows CMD
gradlew.bat check

### For I/O redirection tests
cd text-ui-test
# *nix OS and MacOSX bash
./runtest.sh
# Windows CMD
runtest.bat
```

### Manual Testing
The current version does not support storing the data on the local drive. To start with the manual testing process, you may refer to the "QuickStart" section of the [User Guide](UserGuide.md).
