## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 What is HealthVault?

In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The weakness of modern healthcare systems has surfaced. 
Many of which are unsatisfactory in coping with the current needs.
HealthVault was thus created to improve the efficiency of hospital and healthcare information management.
<br>
**HealthVault** is a desktop application made for healthcare workers as their one-stop application for recording and 
accessing critical patient or staff information.
It is optimized for the Command Line Interface, where an experienced typist will be able to 
make full use of the informative and minimalistic GUI to achieve significant gains in efficiency

### 1.2 About the Developer Guide

The HealthVault Developer guide is made specifically for those who are interested in the specifics of how HealthVault is 
implemented. Such personnel may include: students, technical support staff, web developers, healthcare professionals.

This Developer guide seeks to inform and instruct readers on the architecture and specific implementation of the various
functions within HealthVault. So that if they wish to make any fixes or edits to improve on the code for their own 
usage, they will be well-equipped with both the knowledge and expertise to do so. 

The Developer Guide hopes to impart to you the following:
1. Properly set up for HealthVault
2. HealthVault's system architecture
3. The implementation method for HealthVault's various functions and their considerations
4. Instructions for manual testing of the application

We hope you will have a fruitful time learning about HealthVault.

<br>

**Before writing code**

1. If using IDEA, configuring the code style to set up IDEA’s coding style to match ours.
2. When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about HealthVault’s architecture.

<br>


## 4. Design

###  4.1 Architecture

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/Architecture Diagram.png">

**Overview Architecture:**

Our application utilises many layers of abstraction which allows each individual component to be self-contained yet able to work with other components. Each component has been abstracted and grouped together based on its function and purpose in the system.

The above diagram shows how each component interacts with the other components. The directed arrows represent the direction in which functions of each component is called and used. For example, the Instance Component utilises the Storage Component.

<br>

**Brief Description of Components:**

**UI Component:** Controls all the User Interface. All input and output is handled by the UI component.


**Logic Component:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instance Component: Represents all Menu Instances.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parser Component: Parses user input to obtain control flow decisions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Checker Component: Contains functions to check validity of user input.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commands Component: Command Class Objects which executes specified actions.

**Exceptions Component:** All possible Exceptions identified.

**Model Component:** Consist of the base objects and its collection.

**Storage Component:** Manages all file I/O.

<br>

### 4.2 UI component

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/UML UI.png">

**API :** `UI.java`

The UI of this program can be found under the package named UI. It consists of `UI`, `DoctorAppointmentUI`, `InventoryUI`, `NurseScheduleUI`, `PatientUI` and `StaffUI`.  The main `UI` class as shown in the diagram acts as the parent class with the other classes being its subclasses. Having a main `UI` class allows the program to have a common pool of methods so that each method is reusable in each functionality. Each individual function UI extends the main `UI` and consists of the methods that deals with users unique to their functionality. The UI component interacts with the Logic package and Instance package the most.

**The `UI` component**,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executes user commands using the ‘Logic’ component.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listens to changes to `Instance` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is responsible for handling all input and output of the program. 

<br>

### 4.3 Logic Component

The `Logic` component is responsible for the following tasks:

- Run instances of the various features within HealthVault.
- Converts user inputs into data that is usable by the HealthVault.
- Executes the Command based on interpreted data.

To accomplish the above, the `Logic` component, follows the following sequence of steps:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Interpreting user input**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The `Instance` component runs the main super loop to accept user input. It creates a `Parser` to interpret user inputs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Checking User Input**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The `Parser` creates an `ErrorChecker` class and uses it to check the user input for any erroneous and unacceptable inputs. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Creating Command**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After checking the input, the `Parser` component then creates the `Command` that corresponds to the user input.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Executing Command**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the interpreted `Command` from the `Parser`, the `Instance` component then executes the `Command`.

The following class diagram illustrates the interactions between various logic components

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="diagrams/LogicComponent.png">

The following class diagram illustrates the group of Commands under the `doctorappointment` package. Due to the similar Commands in each of the Command packages, the information in the doctorappointment package should be representative of the other Command packages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="diagrams/ExampleCommandPackage.png">

>:information_source: Similar classes are represented by abbreviations i.e. ABCCommand. The actual class names are written in the notes beside the classes. 
> 
>1. ABCInstance represents the different `Instance` classes.
>2. PQRParser represents the different `Parser` classes.
>3. XYZChecker represents the different `ErrorChecker` classes.
>4. The "XXX"Command in each package under the `Command` package represent the different commands relating to each individual feature.

<br>

### 4.4 Model component

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/UML Model.png">

The Model component consists of classes that represents the collection of objects that a nurse has to interact with.

The `Model`, consists of 5 different types of arraylists.

- AppointmentList stores DoctorAppointment objects. AppointmentList also has methods needed to interact with objects in the arraylist.
- InventoryList stores Inventory objects. InventoryList also has methods needed to interact with objects in the arraylist.
- NurseScheduleList stores NurseSchedule objects. NurseScheduleList also has methods needed to interact with objects in the arraylist.
- PatientList stores Patient objects. PatientList also has methods needed to interact with objects in the arraylist.
- StaffList stores Staff objects. StaffList also has methods needed to interact with objects in the arraylist.

<br>

### 4.5 Storage component
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/UpdatedStorageUML.png">

The Storage component consists of classes that individually reads data from, and writes data to, 5 different .txt files.

The `Storage`, consists of 5 different types of classes:

- DoctorAppointmentStorage implements `writeToFile()` to write information regarding doctorID, name, date, appointmentID, and gender into DoctorAppointment.txt file. `loadFile()`loads the data in the DoctorAppointment.txt file into an array list to be returned. `loadDoctorFile()` loads the doctor information from the staff database.
- InventoryStorage implements `storeInventory()` to write information regarding drug name, price, and quantity into Inventory.txt file. `loadInventory()`loads the data in the Inventory.txt file into an array list to be returned.
- NurseScheduleStorage implements `writeToFile()` to write information regarding nurseID, patientID, date into NurseSchedule.txt file. `loadPatientFile()` loads the patient information from the patient database.
- StaffStorage implements `writeToFile()` to write information regarding staffID, name, age, and specialisation into Staff.txt file. `loadFile()`loads the data in the Patients.txt file into an array list to be returned.
- PatientStorage implements `storePatients()` to write information regarding patientID, name, age, gender, illness, and drugsNeeded into Patient.txt file. `loadPatients()`loads the data in the Patient.txt file into an array list to be returned.

<br>

## 5. Implementation

In this section, we will introduce the implementation of the different functions within each feature.

###  5.1 Staff

### 5.1.1 Staff Menu

Similar to the Start Menu, the Staff Menu will repeatedly request user input until the `return` command is given.

Whenever a user input is given to the Staff Menu, the following steps will occur.

**Launching Staff Menu**

1. `ToStaffInstance.execute()` will create and call `StaffInstance.run()`
2. `StaffInstance.run()` will start by loading/creating the Staff data .txt file for Staff database records. It will check for any signs of corrupted file when loading. An Exception will be thrown if any corruption occurs.
3. `StaffInstance.run()` will then repeatedly call `commandHandler()`.

**Getting User Input**

4. `StaffInstance.run()` will repeatedly request for user input and call `StaffParser.commandHandler()`.
5. `commandHandler()` will call the `smartCommandRecognition()` to assess the given user input and determine which command is most similar to the input
6. Based on the recognised command by the system, the relevant commands will be carried out.

<br>

### 5.1.2 Staff Add

**Implementation:**

The function Add takes in 4 compulsory fields (Staff ID, Name, Age, Specialisation) to create the Staff Object and adds it to an aggregation of Staff Objects. Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an Exception thrown and command aborted. A StaffAddCommand object is created. StaffAddCommand object will be executed to create the Staff Object which will be added to the aggregation of Staff Objects.

Invalid Input includes:

> 
	- Invalid Staff ID format
	- Duplicated Staff ID
	- Age that < 18 or > 150
	- Blank input (i.e Empty inputs)
	- Illegal Characters

**Format** `add/[Staff ID]/[name]/[age]/[specialisation]`

<img src="diagrams/StaffAddSD.png">

**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the add command, `commandHandler()` calls `staffChecker.checkValidDataForAdd()` to ensure data entered is valid
2. `checkValidDataForAdd()` will call the following function in sequence:

	- checkStaffID()	
	- checkDuplicateStaffID()
	- checkStaffAge()
	- checkBlankInput2()
	- invalidCharactersStaffChecker()

**Creating StaffAddCommand object**

3. If the input data is valid, a StaffAddCommand object is created. Else a relevant error is thrown.
4. The StaffAddCommand object is returned to `StaffInstance.run()`

**Creating Staff Object with User Input**

5. StaffInstance then executes the StaffAddCommand object to begin the process of creating the Staff object

6. `StaffAdd.execute()` will call the function in `StaffList.add()`

7. `StaffList.add()` will instantiate a new Staff object and add it to the ArrayList<Staff> StaffList. which contains all the Staff Objects. 

**Saving Staff Objects into .txt file**

8. `StaffList.add()` then calls `staffStorage.writeToFile()` which starts the process of writing the details of all existing Staff Objects, within the StaffList into a specified .txt file.
9. `staffStorage.writeToFile()` then calls `createFile()` which ensures that the specified .txt file exists.
10. Data is written and saved.
11. Control is then returned to StaffInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Deciding the main data structure, ArrayList or Dictionary:

Option 1 (Final choice): Using an ArrayList
* Pros: Able to access a staff information given the unique key and allows for more flexibility in the methods used.
* Cons: Slow accessing of items when searching for information in ArrayList compared to Dictionary.

Option 2 : Using a Dictionary
* Pros: Able utilise the key function of dictionary to locate items quickly.
* Cons: Multiple items to be stored for 1 single key in the dictionary.
* Cons: Listing all information might be rather troublesome.

<br>

### 5.1.3 Staff Delete

**Implementation:**

The function Delete takes in 1 compulsory field (Staff ID) to identify and delete the Staff Object from the aggregation of Staff Objects. Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an Exception thrown and command aborted. After validation, a StaffDelete Command object is created. StaffDelete command object will be executed to iterate through the aggregation of Staff Objects. If Staff Object exists, it will be removed. Else an error message will be displayed.

Invalid Input includes:

> 
	- Invalid Staff ID format
	- Blank input (i.e Empty inputs)
	- Illegal Characters

**Format** `delete/Staff ID`


**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the delete command, `commandHandler()` calls `staffChecker.checkDeleteCommand()` to ensure that there are valid and sufficient inputs

**Creating StaffDelete command**

2. If the input data is valid, a StaffDelete Command object is created 
3. The StaffDelete Command object is returned to `StaffInstance.run()`

**Deleting Staff Object using User Input**

4. StaffInstance then executes the StaffDelete Command object to begin the process of deleting the referenced Staff object
5. `StaffDelete.execute()` will call the function `StaffList.delete()`
6. `StaffList.delete()` will iterate through the objects in ArrayList<Staff> StaffList. The Staff Object referenced by the input given by the user will be deleted.

**Saving changed Staff Objects into .txt file**

7. `StaffList.delete()` then calls staffStorage.writeToFile() which starts the process of writing the changed details of Staff Objects, within the StaffList into a specified .txt file.

8. `staffStorage.writeToFile()` then calls `createFile()` which ensures that the specified .txt file exists.
9. Data is written and saved.
10. Control is then returned to StaffInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Deciding whether to use an iterator to iterate through the ArrayList.

Option 1 (Final choice): Not using an iterator
* Pros: Using the inbuilt commands to iterate through to find the item to delete seems more straightforward.
* Cons: The flexibility of the data manipulation may be restrictive and this may result in future functions being harder to implement.

Option 2 : Using an iterator
* Pros: An iterator allows for more flexible data access as it allows for more efficient deletion of a block of data, and it helps to keep the location of where data was manipulated.
* Cons: Maintenance of the iterator is very difficult, and it may not be worth the effort to implement when solutions exist that only require inbuilt functions.

<br>

### 5.1.4 Staff List

**Implementation:**

The function list takes in 1 option field (nurses/doctors) to identity and list the category of Staff Objects required from the aggregation of Staff Objects. Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an Exception thrown and command aborted. After validation, a StaffList Command object is created. StaffList command object will be executed to iterate through the aggregation of Staff Objects. Staff Objects will then be displayed based on the user given input.

Invalid Input includes:

> 
	- Any input apart from Blank Input (i.e Empty input) OR "doctors" OR "nurses"

**Format** `list/<doctors/nurses>`

**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the list command, `commandHandler()` calls `staffChecker.checkListCommand()` to check and verify the validity of inputs accompanied by the list command, if any.

**Creating StaffList command**

2. If the input data is valid, a StaffList Command object is created 
3. The StaffList Command object is returned to `StaffInstance.run()` 

**Viewing Staff Objects**

4. StaffInstance then executes the StaffList Command object to begin the process of displaying all Staff objects.
5. `StaffList.execute()` will call the function `StaffList.list()`
6. `StaffList.list()` will iterate through the objects in ArrayList<Staff> StaffList. 
7. Depending on the input given by the user, the relevant Staff Objects will be displayed.
8. Control is then returned to StaffInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Deciding whether to have additional capabilities for the list function:

Option 1 (Final choice): Function to list either nurses or doctors.
* Pros: Able to be specific to view specific data items.
* Cons: Implementation will be troublesome. Need to consider the fact that there is variable number of inputs (0/1).

Option 2 : Only have a general list function to see all staff information.
* Pros: Easy implementation.
* Cons: Unable to view just the nurses/doctors information.

<br>

### 5.1.5 Staff Find

**Implementation:**

The function Add takes in 1 compulsory field (keyword) to find the relevant Staff Objects within the aggregation of Staff Objects. Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an Exception thrown and command aborted. The given input is used to match with every single field of the Staff Object. If there is a match, the Staff Object will be displayed. Else, an error message will be displayed.

Invalid Input includes:

> 
	- Blank input (i.e Empty inputs)

**Format** `find/[keyword]`

**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the find command, `commandHandler()` calls `MainChecker.checkNumInput()`. `MainChecker.checkNumInput()` does a simple check to ensure there is an accompanying input given by the user together with the find command.

**Creating StaffFind command**

2. If the input data exist, a StaffFind Command object is created 
3. The StaffFind Command object is returned to `StaffInstance.run()` 

**Finding relevant Staff Objects**

4. StaffInstance then executes the StaffList Command object to begin the process of finding and displaying relevant Staff objects.
5. `StaffFind.execute()` will call the function `StaffList.find()`
6. `StaffList.find()` will iterate through the objects in ArrayList<Staff> StaffList. 
7. `StaffList.find()` will utilise a search function in StaffList to find any Staff Objects that matches the given keyword by the user. 
8. The relevant Staff Objects are then displayed.
9. Control is then returned to StaffInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Deciding whether `find` function should be case-sensitive:

Option 1 (Final choice): Case-insensitive.
* Pros: Provides the user with greater flexibility when querying the list for specific data.
* Cons: Harder to implement and may result in unwanted data being shown.

Option 2 : Case sensitive.
* Pros: Easy to implement and can be more specific.
* Cons: Harder to consistently type and very punishing for users who don't know if what they are searching for has capital letters.

<br>

###  5.2 Patient

### 5.2.1 Patient Menu

The Patient Menu will repeatedly request user input until the `return` command is given.

Whenever a user input is given to the Patient Menu, the following steps will occur.

**Launching Patient Menu**

1. `ToPatientInstance.execute()` will create and call `PatientInstance.run()`
2. `PatientInstance.run()` will start by loading/creating the Patient data .txt file for Patient database records. It will check for any signs of corrupted file when loading and exception will be thrown if any corruption is detected.
3. `PatientInstance.run()` will then enter its running for loop and repeatedly take in user inputs for data processing.

**Getting User Input**

4. `PatientInstance.run()` will repeatedly request for user input and call `PatientParser.patientParse()`.
5. `patientParse()` will call the `smartCommandRecognition()` to assess the given user input and determine which command is most similar to the input.
6. The most relevant command is then returned to the parser, and the parser then scans the input thoroughly based on the command returned. Relevant errors in the input are detected and the appropriate exceptions thrown.
7. Only after scanning the input for errors, will the proper command be returned to `PatientInstance` where it will then be executed.
8. After getting an input, and parsing it into string tokens, a new instance of PatientChecker class `checker` is instantiated to perform error checking.

<br>

### 5.2.2 Patient Add


**Implementation:**

The function Add takes in 6 compulsory fields (Patient ID, Name, Age, Gender, Illness and Medication Required) to create the Patient Object and adds it to a list of Patient Objects.
Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an exception thrown and command aborted. If there are no exceptions thrown, a PatientAdd Command object is created.
The PatientAdd command object will be executed to create the Patient Object which will be added to the list of Patient Objects.

Invalid Input includes:

>
	- Invalid Patient ID format
	- Duplicated Patient ID
	- Age that < 0 or > 150
	- Invalid Gender Input
	- Blank input (i.e Empty inputs)
	- Inputs that only consist of spaces
	- Illegal Characters

**Format**
`add/[Patient ID]/[name]/[age]/[gender]/[illness]/[medication required]`

**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the add command, `patientParse()` calls `checker.checkAdd()` to ensure data entered is valid.
2. `checkAdd()` will call the following methods in sequence:

	- emptySpaceCheck();
		- checkLength();
		- checkID();
		- checkAge();
		- illegalCharacterChecker();
		- checkGender();

**Creating PatientAdd command**

3. If the input data is valid, a PatientAdd Command object is created. Else a relevant error is thrown.
4. The StaffAdd Command object is returned to `PatientInstance.run()`

**Creating Patient Object with User Input**

5. PatientInstance then executes the PatientAdd Command object to begin the process of creating the Patient object

6. `PatientAdd.execute()` will call the function in `PatientList.add()`

7. `PatientList.add()` will instantiate a new Staff object and add it to the ArrayList<Patient> PatientList. which contains all the Patient Objects.

**Saving Patient Objects into .txt file**

8. PatientInstance then calls `PatientStorage.storePatients()` which starts the process of writing the details of all existing Patient Objects, within the PatientList into a specified .txt file.
9. `PatientStorage.storePatients()` then calls `fileInit()` which ensures that the specified .txt file exists.
10. Data is written and saved.
11. Control is then returned to PatientInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Using an ArrayList over a List as the main data structure:

Option 1 (Final choice): Using an ArrayList
* Pros: Able to access a patient given the index and allows for more flexibility in the methods used.
* Cons: Slow accessing when storing and loading as an ArrayList takes more resources than a List.

Option 2 : Using a List
* Pros: Able to load and store very fast and also able to perform functions like "list" fast.
* Cons: No random access and thus made certain functions more troublesome code wise.
<br>

### 5.2.3 Patient Delete

**Implementation:**

The function Delete takes in 1 compulsory field (Patient ID) to identity and delete the Patient Object from the list of Patient Objects. Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an Exception thrown and command aborted. After validation, a PatientDelete Command object is created. The PatientDelete command object will be executed to iterate through the list of Patient Objects. If Patient Object exists, it will be removed. Else an error message will be displayed.

Invalid Input includes:

>
	- Invalid Patient ID format
	- Blank input (i.e Empty inputs)
	- Inputs that only consist of spaces

**Format**
`delete/[Patient ID]`

**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the delete command, `patientParse()` calls `checker.checkLength()` and `checker.checkID()` to ensure data entered is valid.

**Creating PatientDelete command**

2. If the input data is valid, a PatientDelete Command object is created
3. The PatientDelete Command object is returned to `PatientInstance.run()`

**Deleting Patient Object using User Input**

4. PatientInstance then executes the PatientDelete Command object to begin the process of deleting the referenced Patient object
5. `PatientDelete.execute()` will call the function `PatientList.deletePatient()`
6. `PatientList.deletePatient()` will iterate through the objects in ArrayList<Patient> PatientList. The Patient Object referenced by the input given by the user will be deleted.

**Saving changed Staff Objects into .txt file**

7. PatientInstance then calls `PatientStorage.storePatients()` which starts the process of writing the details of all existing Patient Objects, within the PatientList into a specified .txt file.
8. `PatientStorage.storePatients()` then calls `fileInit()` which ensures that the specified .txt file exists.
9. Data is written and saved.
10. Control is then returned to PatientInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Using an iterator to store the location of the item being deleted:

Option 1 (Final choice): Not using an iterator
* Pros: Using the inbuilt commands to iterate through to find the item to delete seems more straightforward.
* Cons: The flexibility of the data manipulation may be restrictive and this may result in future functions being harder to implement.

Option 2 : Using an iterator
* Pros: An iterator allows for more flexible data access as it allows for more efficient deletion of a block of data, and it helps to keep the location of where data was manipulated.
* Cons: Maintenance of the iterator is very difficult, and it may not be worth the effort to implement when solutions exist that only require inbuilt functions.

### 5.2.4 Patient List

**Implementation:**

The function List does not take in any additional inputs, in order to show the user a list of current Patient objects in the database. Data input is first checked to ensure validity. Any invalid input detected will result in an Exception thrown and command aborted. After validation, a PatientList Command object is created. PatientList command object will be executed to iterate through the list of Patient Objects. Patient Objects will then be displayed based on the user given input.

Invalid Input includes:

>
	- Any input apart from Blank Input or a single delimiting slash.

**Format**
`list`

**Check validity of the data input**

1. If the command recognised is the list command, `patientParse()` calls `checker.checkLength()` to ensure data entered is valid.

**Creating PatientList command**

2. If the input data is valid, a PatientList Command object is created
3. The PatientList Command object is returned to `PatientInstance.run()`

**Viewing Patient Objects**

4. PatientInstance then executes the PatientList Command object to begin the process of displaying all Patient objects.
5. `PatientList.execute()` will call the function `PatientList.listPatients()`
6. `PatientList.listPatients()` will iterate through the objects in ArrayList<Patient> PatientList.
7. Patient Objects will be displayed.
8. Control is then returned to PatientInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Using pretty print to display the listed objects:

Option 1 (Final choice): Using pretty print
* Pros: Visually appealing and neatly puts patients in rows with columns to display attributes. Better for larger lists.
* Cons: Harder to implement and sometimes causes visual errors when the names or display text become too large.

Option 2 : Printing the patients in blocks with no common rows or columns.
* Pros: Easy to implement and may be easier to show a single patient.
* Cons: Very difficult to view when the list of patients became increasingly large.

  <br>

### 5.2.5 Patient Find

**Implementation:**

The function Find takes in 1 compulsory field (keyword) to find the relevant Patient Objects within the list of Patient Objects. Data input is first checked to ensure validity.

If there is a match, the Patient Object will be displayed. Else, an error message will be displayed.

Invalid Input includes:

>
	- Blank input (i.e Empty inputs)
	- Illegal Characters
	- Inputs that only consist of spaces

**Format**
`find/[keyword]`

<img src="diagrams/PatientFindSD.png">

**sub-diagram to show the ref**

<img src="diagrams/PatientFindParseSD.png">

**Check validity of the data input**

2. `checkFind()` will call the following methods in sequence:

	- emptySpaceCheck();
		- checkLength();
		- illegalCharacterChecker();

**Creating PatientFind command**

3. If the input data exist, a PatientFind Command object is created
4. The PatientFind Command object is returned to `PatientInstance.run()`

**Finding relevant Patient Objects**

5. PatientInstance then executes the PatientFind Command object to begin the process of finding and displaying relevant Patient objects.
6. `PatientFind.execute()` will call the function `PatientList.findPatient()`
7. `PatientList.findPatient()` will iterate through the objects in ArrayList<Patient> PatientList.
8. `PatientList.findPatient()` will compare the patient details of every Patient Object in the current list of Patient Objects with the keyword inputted by the user and discover any matches.
9. The relevant Patient Objects are then displayed.
10. Control is then returned to PatientInstance.

**Design Considerations**

Allowing `find` function to accept case-insensitive inputs:

Option 1 (Final choice): Allowing case-insensitive inputs.
* Pros: Provides the user with greater flexibility when querying the list for specific data.
* Cons: Harder to implement and may result in unwanted data being shown.

Option 2 : Only allowing case-sensitive inputs.
* Pros: Easy to implement and can be more specific.
* Cons: Harder to consistently type and very punishing for users who don't know if what they are searching for has capital letters.
